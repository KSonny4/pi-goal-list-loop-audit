# Changelog

## Unreleased — rapid-first-hour + same-model-first

- Main-model recovery is now rapid-first: flat 5s probes for the first 720 attempts (~first hour via `MAIN_MODEL_RAPID_ATTEMPTS`), then `base → 2x → 4x → cap 5h` ladder. `mainModelFailureDelayMs` delegates to `mainModelRetryDelayMs` (single source).
- Same-model-first minute: `tryMainModelFallback` + delayed probes stay on the current model for the first 12 attempts (`MAIN_MODEL_SAME_MODEL_ATTEMPTS`, 12x5s) before walking the fallback chain. Blips recover without a switch.

## 0.38.27 — selective port of PRs #45/#46: /loop pause + widget subtask count (2026-09-08)

### Added
- `/loop pause` soft-hold (ported from Bjynt's PR #46): parallel to `/goal pause` and `/glla pause` — clears the tick, holds iteration/best/history verbatim with `stopReason: "paused by user (/loop pause)"`, ledger `loop_paused`, no `finishLoopGit`, no queue advance; `/loop resume` picks it up via the extended `RESUMABLE_STOP`. Pinned by `tests/loop-pause.test.ts` (3 tests).
- Widget task count: a closed parent covers its subtasks (ported from Bjynt's PR #45 — field symptom 6 real tasks displayed "2/24"). Pinned (7/12 + 1/4 cases).
- Held with recorded rationale (`audit/PR-45-46-DISPOSITION-2026-09-08.md`): `auditTasks` per-task auditor (token-cost surface needs dedicated review), `bypassTriggered` abort shortening (round-trip untested + v0.38.24 abort-latch interaction unverified); dropped the malformed "best solution" auditor line (taste-judge scope creep). Full gate 1990 pass / 0 fail.

## 0.38.26 — approval-render store: spillway cap keeps undelivered renders (2026-09-08)

### Fixed
- Post-tag review of the v0.38.25 store: the sidecar cap could trim undelivered renders past 20 entries (non-positive slice budget). The cap now applies to delivered history only — undelivered renders are never dropped (self-draining: any user command replays them). Same 7 behavioral pins green; full gate 1986 pass / 0 fail.

## 0.38.25 — post-objective summary: canonical approval render, persist + replay, audit-goal counts (2026-09-07)

### Fixed
- Field failure: goal `20260907131550-12ddoy` completed with a perfect six-label archive record, but the approval chat lines fired into a dead context (auditor verdict landed with no live turn) — record perfect, delivery silent. Cross-harness survey (`audit/POST-OBJECTIVE-SUMMARY-2026-09-07.md`): Codex CLI 0.147.0 and Claude Code both leave the final message to the agent and standardize only usage/session-persistence/resume; pi-goal-x (in-repo v0.26.1 source) fixes the report order (verdict → complete → task summary → detail) — validating the outcome-first shape. Nobody persists the render; GLLA now does.
- ONE canonical builder: `buildTerminalApprovalRender` (outcome + ≤2 details + approval + counts + record) feeds chat, transcript, external, and the persisted render on all three approval paths (detached auditor, manual verify, Esc-without-audit). `buildApprovalChatLines` gains an optional `counts` slot (backward compatible); the stale pre-verdict `Next:` stays stripped everywhere.
- Audit-goal counts line rides every render, built from durable state only: `— run: 42 turns · 17 file writes · 23 bash calls · auditor approved (1 verdict).` Absent facts are named as absent; the no-audit path says so honestly.
- Persist + replay: renders persist to `.pi-glla/pending-approval-renders.json` at archive time with `delivered: !isIdle()` (the probe fails toward undelivered — a duplicate beats a loss). All five command handlers (`/goal /glla /review /list /loop`) replay undelivered renders on live contact, fire-once fenced via `deliveredAt`, ledgered (`terminal_approval_render_persisted/_replayed`), corrupt-store safe. Coverage: 7 new behavioral pins + updated source-grep contract.

## 0.38.24 — audit pass: abort-latch send guards, ownership compare-and-swap, auditor inherit parity (2026-09-07)

### Fixed
- Full display/lifecycle/settings audit pass (goal `20260907131550-12ddoy`, three parallel read-only scouts): 44 findings → 0 open. Display decisions (user-grilled): head owns liveness (status drops the `LIVE` capsule/tails, keeps `[WORKING]` + counts), exceptions-only `quiet` default (troubled rows + count line; healthy fan-out lives on the fleet panel), `active {age}` / `quiet {age}` worker labels.
- Lifecycle HIGH: `sendContinuation` / `sendStallEscalation` / `sendLengthContinue` refuse on `flags.abortedStandDown`; terminal-notice refusal scoped to the abort latch so transcript closure still wins; zombie retry routes on the abort-closure owner (loop abort no longer stranded by a goal started mid-delay); cycle-reset consumes budget (`attempts+1`) and honors the 24h horizon while the probe turn stays prompt per the v0.34.132 contract.
- Lifecycle MED/LOW: fallback `agent_start`/`turn_start` acks refuse on intervening user messages; successor absorb + self-heal share `clearDeadGenerationDispatch` (no more idle behind a "re-armed" lie); ownership refresh is compare-and-swap (live foreign claims never clobbered; dead records still refresh for heartbeat reclaim); command entry forces a fresh ownership read past the background throttle; length-continue lost its stale-classifier exemption.
- Settings: `stallShortWords: 0` (= off) survives normalization; auditor thinking gains the drafter's `session — inherit` row + non-reasoning picks clear stale overrides; bare `/glla fallbacks` reads on stale handles (only `clear/off/unset/none` mutates); typing `auto` in the notify editor round-trips to unset; v0.38.23 comment/doc drift swept (richness/quiet copy, reviewer write→migrate lifecycle, DESIGN one-line rows, SETTINGS wedge vs aggressive default). Full audit: `audit/AUDIT-PASS-2026-09-07.md`. Coverage: `release:check` 1979 pass / 0 fail.

## 0.38.23 — below-chat widget: forced placement, single-line rows, evidence lifesign (2026-09-07)

### Fixed
- Below-chat pinning (field: GLLA card vs fleet visibly swapping slots across ticks, 2026-09-06 screenshots). The `pi-glla` widget now passes `{ placement: "belowEditor" }` — the same zone the native fleet defaults to — so both surfaces stop trading places. Forced, not a setting: one stable layout for everyone, no new settings row or drift pin.
- Extension-meta footers deleted. The orphan-worker `└─ /glla agents for full worker detail`, the card `└─ /goal status · /glla` / `└─ /list · /glla` hints, and the `… N more agents · /glla agents` overflow pointer all named our extension, not the user's task — pure noise once `/glla` is known. Queue depth survives as task info (`└─ N queued`); empty queue means no footer at all.
- Option-2 worker rows: one glyph-first line per tracked child (`▶ scout · ui-fixes · silent 2m`, `⚠ worker · art-batch · silent 31m`), age before any suffix so narrow-terminal truncation cuts the least important field first. The `→ <objective>` task-linkage header is gone (the card head already names the objective — it repeated it verbatim), ids stay in the `/glla agents` table, overflow names its count only. `/glla agents` full table untouched (`└ blocks:`, Recent hangs, abort guidance all intact).
- Evidence lifesign on active-clear heads: freshest-worker-evidence readout as the last head segment (`· stream 8s`), breathing glyph derived from evidence counters (`Σ toolUses + outputTokens mod 4` over `●→◉→○→◉`) — never from wall-clock, so the widget key stays stable between evidence and the v0.37.1 re-layout cannot return. Fresh (<5m) breathes, aging (5–30m) freezes the ring, stale (30m+) hollows it, a hung child triangles the head. Non-active statuses (⏸/⟡/⚠/⏳) keep their own glyph language; no rows means no readout invented.
- Semantic color ramp on head glyph + age text + row glyphs only (success <5m, warning to 30m, error past it; queued caps at amber — waiting is not broken; meter stays progress-colored, fleet line untouched). Color never rides alone: glyph shape (▶/◉/⚠) plus the silence number carry the same meaning unpainted, and a no-theme render contains zero ANSI. Coverage: `tests/lifesign.test.ts` (7 tests: bands incl. queued cap, empty-invents-nothing, counter-derived breath, head readout/triangle/pause/bare, row color + unpainted shape+number, 80-col fit + bucket key-stability) plus reshaped pins in `display`/`agents-panel`/`subagent-display-richness`.
## Unreleased — strict auditor routing (#153)

- Explicit auditor chains no longer append or admit the host route, including swap disabled. Project fallback arrays replace globals, preserving explicit `[]`; malformed authority blocks.
- Paired snapshot path/SHA-256 enforcement precedes state-root selection and rejects effective project conflicts. Required extensions resolve strictly and dispatch uses captured absolute paths with fresh alias-drift validation.
- Definite billing/authentication denial consumes one route call without cooldown. Effective routing fingerprints and started receipts fence every retry/restart; exact retained results replay without a new worker, while unknown outcomes and legacy identities block.
- See [strict auditor routing and recovery](docs/strict-auditor-routing.md) for compatibility, operator reauthorization, retained evidence and deterministic validation. No package release, install, or deployment is included.

## 0.38.22 — subagent display unification: richness ladder + upstream triple-render report (2026-09-05)

### Fixed
- Subagent display unification (field: triple-rendered run panels swapping order with agent prose, 2026-09-05 screenshot). New `subagentDisplayRichness` setting (`/glla` → Subagents): `rich` (default — detailed worker rows + the task-linkage header `→ <objective>` native UI can never show), `compact` (today's count line), `quiet` (hung/aborting workers only — HUNG is never silent at any level). Rich is safe against the v0.37.1 jumping because `renderAgentsWidgetLines` now buckets silence ages exactly like the compact line, so the widget key only moves on genuine state transitions. Status-bar worker count follows the same ladder automatically. `/glla agents` keeps full detail regardless. Upstream triple-render + order-swap filed as nicobailon/pi-subagents#1931 (read-only diagnosis; GLLA cannot suppress/reorder/merge native panels — no ordering API, transcript components order by arrival); README documents the coexistence escapes (`inlineToolDisplay: "summary"` + `fleetViewPlacement` pin). Coverage: `tests/subagent-display-richness.test.ts` (5 tests: default/normalization, ladder assembly + linkage header, bucket stability, hung invariant, width safety).

## 0.38.21 — objection-attached retries + PR #43 auditor observability (2026-09-04)

### Fixed
- Objection-attached retries: disapproval rounds are now scoped, not just listed. A new disapproval supersedes older live rounds (`superseded` / `supersededBy: disapproval:<at>` on the verdict) and a clean approval clears the objection pin (`supersededBy: approval:<at>`); shield-blocked approvals clear too (the claim passed audit — only the evidence citation failed), while infra errors and impossibles never touch the flags. The continuation prompt argues the latest LIVE disapproval (`liveDisapproval`) instead of merely the last history entry, and names the settled rounds (`Settled rounds (superseded, do not relitigate)`) so retries argue only live objections. Both verdict push sites (detached + manual-verify) now share one `appendAuditVerdict` helper — the hand-rolled duplicates are gone — and the pin embeds report content already stored in `auditHistory`, never a path into a reaped job dir. Honest scope note: the full-report surfacing itself shipped in v0.35.x (`## LATEST AUDITOR`); this slice adds the missing round scoping. Coverage: `tests/objection-pinning.test.ts` (behavioral two-round MockPi drive with true fail-before + helper pins for approval/shield/error paths).
- Merged PR #43 (Bjynt): detached-auditor observability — opt-in `auditorInspection` persistent sessions (`--session <jobDir>/session.jsonl`, tail/read-only live, resumable after; default off, byte-identical spawn when off), configurable `auditJobRetentionMs` (default 15m = legacy constant, bounds 0–7d), and the post-completion transcript survival fix (finished dirs keep dir+lock, classified `dead` instead of `ambiguous`). Merged with union resolution against v0.38.20's approval voice (inspection pointer appended after `buildApprovalChatLines`). Defaults kept as shipped (inspection off, 15m).

## 0.38.20 — approval-notify cleanup (2026-09-04)

### Fixed
- Approval chat notify no longer reprints the agent's pre-verdict recap verbatim: the stale `Next: <verdict pending>` line (which read as complete-before-verify next to the approval trailer) is stripped on every approval surface, and the chat notify is outcome + at most two informing details + approval trailer + archive record pointer (`buildApprovalChatLines`, `withoutStaleNext`). The transcript notice keeps the informing details minus the stale Next. Applied to all three `✓ done` paths (detached approval, manual-verify approval, no-audit complete).
- Field note: the 19:20 `...` cuts were v0.38.13 word-boundary `…` clips working as designed (every cut lands on a word boundary), not mid-word mangling — but five 120-char label lines still scan as soup, which the cap above addresses. The same session showed zero `terminal_completion_notice_*` events because the tab runs pre-v0.38.18 loaded code — `/reload` to pick up the notice path.

## 0.38.19 — disapproval response: dispatch stall root-cause + state clear (2026-09-04)

### Fixed
- Track 2 root cause (post-answer stall): the wait-for-idle send gate deferred an owed continuation forever when the session went phantom-busy — busy, nothing pending, zero stream (neonbreak: 35 re-arms, zero sends, 45m to the zombie abort). A busy session with nothing pending and no real stream for `GLLA_BUSY_SILENT_SEND_MS` (default 5m) is wedged, not working: the marker is now sent into pi's followUp queue instead (`goal_continuation_send_busy_bypass`, `busyBypass` on the sent event). Genuinely working sessions and loaded queues keep the old wait path.
- Track 3 state clear (stale waiting-verdict): `auditorDisplayPhase` projects `awaiting-verdict` only while the goal is still `auditing`. Closed goals (complete/aborted) and pre-archive snapshots carrying a stale running claim fall through to the quiet gate — no stale progress object can resurrect the wait after `goal_archived`.
- Both fixes carry behavioral MockPi regression tests with empirical fail-before (old code fails the new assertions, guards pass throughout): `tests/answered-question-dispatch.test.ts` (3), `tests/closed-goal-clears-waiting.test.ts` (2).

## 0.38.18 — completion/lifecycle field trilogy (2026-09-04)

### Fixed
- Track 1 (pipe-syntax): the mechanical pre-audit checker runs narrow `cmd 2>&1 | tail/head/grep` pipelines shell-free with pipefail-head semantics instead of 126-rejecting finished work (`parseMechanicalPipeline`, `runMechanicalPipeline`; `tee`/grep-file-flags still refused).
- Track 2 (post-answer stall): a turn that never streamed parks on the first abort with no hot retry (`zombie_auto_retry_refused_never_streamed`, honest park copy), and the rearm milestone names an open-but-silent turn instead of claiming "no turn started".
- Track 3 (stale waiting-verdict): the detached-approval branch delivers the `✓ done` brief into the conversation as a fire-once followUp turn (`sendTerminalCompletionNotice`), so the transcript records the archive instead of narrating "waiting" forever. Skipped for manual `/goal verify` (in-turn closure already exists).

## 0.38.17 — release-contract docs trail (2026-09-04)

### Fixed
  `docs/INDEX.md` trail reaches the current version (the v0.38.16 tag shipped without it, failing the publish gate's docs-index pin). Process lesson, now enforced by habit: bump the version FIRST and run the gate against the release tree, or keep `docs/INDEX.md` in the same commit as the bump — the release-contract test already demands it.

## 0.38.16 — subagent dialect (2026-09-04)

### Fixed
  Prompts and user-facing strings no longer name the dead tintinweb `Agent`/`get_subagent_result` tools — they speak the current `subagent` tool, `bg_wait` settle, and the live roles (`scout`, `worker`, `reviewer`, GLLA-managed `Designer`). The `` `Agent: Designer` `` objective syntax is unchanged (GLLA's own task convention). `isSubagentProviderFailure` now matches `subagent`/`subagent_wait` failures, so real spawn failures take the provider-retry path again. Evidence in `audit/SUBAGENT-DIALECT-2026-09-04.md`.

## 0.38.15 — pause anti-confabulation (2026-09-04)

### Changed
  `pause_goal` refuses pauses whose blocker claims a GLLA tool is missing (dispatch proves the batch landed) and tells the model to call it; quoting pi's `Tool X not found` is accepted as genuine outage. Runbook + new-tab forensics in `audit/PAUSE-ANTI-CONFABULATION-2026-09-04.md`.

## 0.38.14 — human end-of-objective briefing (2026-09-04)

### Changed
  Every `✓ done` chat notify is now a human briefing: outcome first in its own words, only informing labels after it (`none` / `not recorded` / empty filler dropped; `none — <content>` keeps the content). Word-boundary cuts, auditor/no-audit trailer, archive keeps the full six-label record. Runbook in `audit/HUMAN-BRIEF-2026-09-04.md`.

## 0.38.13 — good completion summary (2026-09-04)

### Changed
  The `✓ done` chat notify is now the six-label block (one `Label: value` line each, 240-char word-bounded values) instead of the single-line mash with mid-word cuts. New `clipSummaryValue` cuts at word boundaries everywhere (hard-cut only for spaceless tokens); widget card and external notifies keep the compact line. Fixed a post-archive null crash that silently swallowed the notify. Runbook in `audit/COMPLETION-SUMMARY-2026-09-04.md`.

## 0.38.12 — last-wins sessions + objectives (2026-09-04)

### Changed
  A fresh main-host session_start now takes the state root automatically when a live foreign owner holds it (ledger `owner_superseded`); the dethroned session stands down to read-only on its next throttled recheck (`owner_stood_down`) — never signaled, workers can never steal. `/goal start <objective>` skips the conflict dialog as explicit consent (ledgered `replace via: start-explicit`); plain `/goal` keeps update/cancel. `setGoal` never refuses the new objective over an archive failure — the old objective is preserved in `goal_superseded_unarchived` and the new goal starts anyway. Runbook in `audit/LAST-WINS-2026-09-04.md`.

## 0.38.11 — state-root owner takeover (2026-09-03)

### Added
  `/glla owner` (read-only holder inspection: pid/comm/since/idle/session + verdict) and `/glla takeover` (consented steal). Dead/released/recycled owners reclaim without signaling; a live foreign owner is SIGTERMed only after explicit confirm, only when pi-shaped, and claimed only after verified exit — a survivor is never claimed. Owner heartbeat refreshes throttled on agent_end so idle is measurable. Both read-only warnings point at the new commands. Runbook in `audit/OWNER-TAKEOVER-2026-09-03.md`.

## 0.38.10 — emergency compactor handoff (2026-09-03)

### Added
  Emergency-only compactor: on starvation-refuse engage (one shot per episode) resolve a handoff model via the new `compactorModel` + `compactorModelFallbacks` 0-10 chain (Main/drafter/auditor parity, new Compactor settings tab), then registry plan B (verified free-only, contextWindow >= measured need, unknown metadata disqualified, stuck model excluded, max 2 attempts, rationale ledgered), then skip with ledger. A tool-less `pi -p` worker compresses a bounded disk-state packet into a ~2k handoff brief; resync + recovery banner quote it (warm `/new` + resume); a desktop page fires alongside (`notifyCmd: "off"` respected). Runbook in `audit/COMPACTOR-HANDOFF-2026-09-03.md`.

### Fixed
  Walked-away-stuck sessions no longer sit mute at 101%: refuse now pages the user and preserves a narrative handoff. `/goal` draft-to-trigger gap closed (goal `20260903175837-9lag0s` triggered via the extension's own writers after the Confirm dialog proved unreachable from a tool-less session).

## 0.38.9 — over-cap strategy stated and pinned (2026-09-03)

### Added
  Explicit rung order for over-cap + model-can't-compress: always-on checkpoint projection (trim), guarded fallback-chain rotation on compact failure, `/new` + resume from durable state as the backstop — with the viability ranking (switch when a bigger model exists, `/new` when none can compress). Runbook in `audit/OVERCAP-STRATEGY-2026-09-03.md`.

### Fixed
  Stale advice: the ladder no longer advises a `/compact` retry when one already failed inside the 90s grace window (`recentCompact` → step (1) points at (2)/(3)). `tests/overcap-strategy.test.ts` (3 tests) pins the skip shape and both behavioral chain branches (rotation with chain, honest ladder without).

## 0.38.8 — TUI information-density pass (2026-09-03)

### Added
  Widget `audits:` row (verdict tally, width-truncated, silent when empty); verdict tally suffix on all paused status lines via `pausedStatusSuffix`; per-tab row counts in the settings menu (`settingsTabLabel`, pure). Starvation ladder reflowed to one recovery per line, same content and phrases.

### Fixed
  Glance-density gaps: parked sessions read as waiting-with-history instead of dead; ladder recoveries scannable; settings tabs locate content. Display-only — no automation, hold, auditor, or menu-structure changes. `tests/tui-density.test.ts` (5 tests) pins all four surfaces plus an 80-column widget fit; before/after captures in `audit/TUI-DENSITY-2026-09-03.md`.

## 0.38.7 — session visibility: recovery banner + durable verdict tally (2026-09-03)

### Added
  Load-hold recovery banner: a consent-less cold load that engages the load hold now also paints objective + next pending task + verdict tally + resume command (`/goal`/`/list`/`/loop` by policy), all from durable disk state — the transcript is empty in exactly the sessions that need this. Fires once with the fresh hold; ledger `load_hold_recovery_banner`. Durable verdict tally (`auditorVerdictTally` via `auditVerdictLabel`): disapproval count + last-verdict age on the auditing status-line footer and the `/goal status` `Audits:` line, silent when history is empty — a reloaded session answers "are we progressing?" from stored verdicts.

### Fixed
  Reload invisibility: resumed-but-empty sessions no longer look goal-less, and capped/queued auditor sessions show stored-verdict evidence instead of a dead surface. Hold mechanics, hold text, auditor phase machine, and auditor card untouched. `tests/session-visibility.test.ts` (5 tests) pins tally classification, banner text, status-line tally, and a behavioral reload.

## 0.38.6 — over-cap starvation ladder: compact first, then 5 ordered recoveries (2026-09-03)

### Added
  Compact-first nudge: at 85% context (below the 90% starvation line) a one-shot-per-episode notify to run `/compact` while summarization still fits (episode resets below 80% or on compaction; ledger `context_compact_first_nudge`). The agent_end starvation yield notify now carries the full over-cap ladder — `/compact` retry after GLLA's deterministic trim, larger-context model (GLLA already auto-rotates its fallback chain after a failed compact-and-retry, v0.34.116), `/new` + `/goal resume` from durable disk state with no summarization needed — and states that automatic turns stay parked.

### Fixed
  Over-cap spin: `sendContinuation` now refuses while `isContextStarvedRefused()` — the single choke point every automatic path funnels through — so a 119–243% session stops queueing truncating turns (ledger `continuation_send_refused_context_starved`, silent; heartbeat one-shot + yield ladder own messaging). The refuse stays sticky while the last-known percent is ≥90% instead of lapsing 90s after the last yield. Heartbeat refuse branch/ledger/text unchanged (pinned). `tests/starvation-ladder.test.ts` (6 tests) pins band, ladder text, nudge episodes, sticky matrix, wiring, and a behavioral starved boot.

## 0.38.5 — delta-only goal continuation: marker-only steady-state (2026-09-03)

### Fixed
  Ongoing-conversation resend: steady-state goal turns now send the 45-char `[GOAL CHECKPOINT goalId=…]` marker only instead of the full ~23k continuation prompt every turn (history already holds T0 objective/contract/tasks + `complete_task` deltas). Post-compact sends `resync + marker` (~250 chars); full sends only on first-send per process or dynamic deltas (`repairTarget` / `autoResumedAt` / auditor TODOs / audit report / stale-approval mismatch / designer / full-audit). Marker still carries the dispatch marker so `before_agent_start` start-proof keeps matching; `agent_start`/`turn_start` fallback needs no prompt. Ledger `goal_continuation_sent` gains `kind` (`full`/`full+resync`/`resync`/`marker`) + `payloadChars`. Loop turns unchanged (per-iteration prompts vary). `extensions/goal-continuation.ts` (`buildMarkerContent` / `needsFullContinuation` / `buildContinuationContent`); `tests/delta-only-continuation.test.ts` pins the matrix.

## 0.38.4 — human-input zombie stand-down (PR #36 slice) + AVO close (2026-09-02)

### Fixed
  Zombie watchdog no longer aborts while waiting on human input: `pause_goal`, `propose_goal_draft`, `propose_loop_draft`, `propose_loop_refine`, `propose_task_list`, `list_add`, `list_activate`, and `ask_user_question` now stand down the `BUSY + zero stream` abort exactly like `subagent` waits (field: drafting confirm / decision popup / `ask_user_question` looked like a hung provider, the bounded abort parked the dialog and the retry re-opened the same dialog). Own ledger `zombie_run_stood_down_user_input` vs `zombie_run_stood_down_subagent_wait`; genuinely hung streams still abort after the grace window. Selective port of PR #36 `USER_INPUT_WAIT_TOOL_NAMES` + `isUserInputWaitCall` with `heartbeatTick` carve-out; `tests/zombie-user-input-standdown.test.ts` pins the set and the branch.

### Changed
  AVO consideration closed: `audit/AVO-DEEP-DIVE-2026-09-02.md` remains the full read (`Vary(Pt)=Agent(Pt,K,f)`, §3.3 3-sentence supervisor). PR #22 (stagnation nudge, true AVO pattern but P1s: raw HEAD, no fencing, cycling-cap bypass) and PR #36 (commissar not AVO) dispositioned as `no merge as-is`; only the zombie stand-down ships in this release. PRs to be closed.

## 0.38.3 — truncate picker/settings titles to terminal width (PR #41) (2026-09-02)

### Fixed
  `Rendered line N exceeds terminal width` crash when opening `Main/Auditor fallback models` (and `ModelPicker` / `SettingsMenu`) — long help titles now truncated with `truncateToWidth(…, "…")` to the available width, matching existing picker-row truncation. Prevents `pi` TUI crash that made the `glla: [LIVE]` widget disappear between audit/loop iterations and after `page.reload()`/`/reload` (Next item `audit ended between loops, and the ui disappeared` / Screenshot_20260902_121313). Regression test `multi-model-picker: render truncates a long title to the terminal width` pins 140-col rendering.

## 0.38.2 — thinking selected with model, remove standalone rows (2026-09-02)

### Changed
  `Drafter thinking` and `Auditor thinking` standalone rows removed from `/glla` — thinking is now selected **with** the model pick (the existing `Drafter agent` / `Auditor agent` flows already prompt for thinking immediately after the model, and that ladder is model-aware via `auditorThinkingLevels`). Main had no standalone thinking row; Drafter/Auditor now match it. Stored `drafterThinkingLevel` / `auditorThinkingLevel` keys remain read for fallback-chain rendering (`modelThinkingText`) and for the model-pick ladder, but there is no separate editor — re-pick the model to change thinking. Prevents stale thinking selection and the "Main has no selector, others do" inconsistency.

## 0.38.1 — drafter/auditor fallback parity with Main (2026-09-02)

### Fixed
  Drafter model selection now emits the same `model_fallback_select` ledger as Main (`scope: drafter`) for every forbidden/unregistered skip, so `forbiddenModels` edits mid-interview are honored even when the user edits settings while the interview is open.

  Drafter recovery after a provider failure now walks the dedicated 0-10 chain via `ModelSelector` with the bounded ladder (`5s → base*2^(n-1) cap 5h`, base `mainModelRetryMinutes` default 15) and `forbiddenModels` re-check, instead of an immediate unbounded loop over the lease candidates. Same-model pin (drafter pinned to the session model) remains a same-model retry and is preserved.

  Auditor `model_fallback_select` ledger (`scope: auditor`) now fires for both the settings-time `resolveAuditorModel` walk and the detached audit fallback (`runAuditorFallbackWithPolicy` via `runDetachedCompletionWithFallback`), closing the gap where detached retries skipped forbidden/unregistered refs silently. `forbiddenRefs` and `retryBaseMinutes` were already wired; `onSelection` is now forwarded.

### Changed
  `Drafter fallback agents` menu row → `Drafter fallback models (up to 10)` with count prefix `N/10 · 1. ref → 2. ref` and the shared `ordered and deselectable: current drafter → fallback 1 → fallback 2…` description, matching Main and Auditor rows. Prompt title and notification strings updated to `models` vocabulary. Watchdog budgets (`auditorToolTimeoutMs 5m`, `auditorStallMs 10m` x2 cap 4x) remain independent of the ladder and unchanged.

## 0.38.0 — event-driven supervision and drafting discipline (2026-09-02)

### Fixed
  Keep-checking supervision: scheduling is now event-driven for every plane (including `isMonitorGoal` daemons) — lifecycle/durable/child-progress signals via `ContinuousSupervisor` plus 250ms→15s adaptive fallback poll, not a guessed task-duration wait. The 120s `GLLA_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS` throttle that made a 10s task wait up to 120s is deprecated (`void MONITOR_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS`) and kept only for display parity (`👁 MONITORING` badge). A 10s task is now picked up after ~10s even when guessed at 10m.

  Pinned context-growth fixtures (`tests/context-growth-measurement.test.ts`, `tests/context-checkpoint.test.ts`) refreshed for the larger continuation prompt (23015 chars, 23123 bytes) so `npm run test:all` stays green.

### Changed
  Drafting-batches zero mid-execution questions: `buildSeedGrillMessage` now batches 2-4 sharp, seed-specific questions up front in one `ask_user_question` picker with recommended defaults per question. `LONG_RUNNING_JUDGMENT_POLICY` and `ACTIVE_EXECUTION_QUESTION_GUIDANCE` plus `prompts/goal-loop-continuation.md` enforce drafting as the only place to gather scope/acceptance — active execution targets zero further clarification unless irreversible/destructive, missing permission, or comparable-cost, picking the safest contract-preserving default otherwise and deferring preferences to the completion summary.

  `docs/DESIGN-long-running-supervision.md` now documents both Now requirements and the display-only monitor contract.

## 0.37.3 — pi 0.84 loop stall fix — agent_start fallback for continuation start proof (2026-09-02)

### Fixed
  `continuation_start_unacknowledged` stall on every `/loop` iteration under pi >=0.84 — `before_agent_start` is not emitted for `sendMessage({ deliverAs: "followUp" })` continuations, so the start proof never arrived (10/10 `loop_turn_sent` unacknowledged in issue #40). `dispatchStartAcknowledged` now accepts `agent_start`/`turn_start` as fallback while keeping `before_agent_start`+marker as primary; owner/generation/foreign fences still apply so only an unrelated manual turn in the same session could falsely settle — strictly better than 0% success. Ledger records `startProofSource` as `agent_start`/`turn_start` when fallback fires.

  Hardcoded 60s retry backoff after the first 30s start-proof window is now env-configurable (`GLLA_CONTINUATION_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`, legacy `GLLA_CONTINUATION_START_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`) independent of `GLLA_CONTINUATION_START_TIMEOUT_MS`, so slow local models can extend both windows (observed 5m + 60s hard cap in issue #40 secondary).

### Added
  Regression pins for the fallback path and env var (`tests/loop-start-proof-fallback.test.ts`, `tests/stale-api-terminal.test.ts`, `tests/stall-handling.test.ts`).

## 0.37.2 — queued vs monitoring visuals and long-running daemon handling (2026-09-01)

### Added
  Monitor icon for long-running daemon/supervisor goals: goals matching
  `daemon|supervisor|keep.*running|monitor|healthz` or with `total >1h` are
  displayed as `👁 MONITORING` (dim) instead of `⏳ QUEUED` (accent), with
  "next check" instead of "awaiting pi turn", and are scheduled with
  `GLLA_MONITOR_INTERVAL_MS` (default 120s) instead of immediate continuation
  to avoid constant queued churn.

### Changed
  `QUEUED` now renders as `⏳ QUEUED` in accent blue (distinct from `BUSY`
  warning yellow) with `awaiting pi turn` detail, fixing the "mistook it
  for stuck" report (note.md 2026-09-01, screenshots 190127/193438/193529).
  `LIVE · WORKING` remains success-accent with signal.

### Fixed
  Stale `followUp` continuations that survived `archiveCurrentGoal` via Pi's
  `followUpQueue` are sanitized at `message_end` (ExtensionRunner →
  AgentSession) plus timer disarm at archival — `LENGTH_CONTINUE` and foreign
  ctx are exempt.

## 0.37.1 — auditor watchdogs, continuous list handoff, and audit hardening (2026-09-01)

### Added
  Configurable detached-auditor watchdog budgets (`auditorToolTimeoutMs` and
  `auditorStallMs`, global-scope settings edited via `/glla` with plain-ms or
  s/m/h duration input) replace the hardcoded 5-minute per-tool and 10-minute
  no-progress defaults. Both dispatch sites now thread the configured values
  into the parent watchdogs AND into the worker environment
  (`GLLA_AUDITOR_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS` / `GLLA_AUDITOR_STALL_MS`), so parent and
  worker can never disagree about who kills first.

  Adaptive timeout escalation for stalled auditor attempts: each consecutive
  kill-and-restart of the same claim doubles the per-tool and first-event
  budgets (capped at 4x the configured base), persisted on the durable claim
  as `timeoutEscalation` so slow local models get a growing budget instead of
  an identical kill-and-restart loop on every restart.

  Progress-aware watchdog: the parent progress signature now includes streamed
  report bytes, so an actively-streaming model (including extended thinking
  between tool calls) registers as live progress instead of tripping the
  no-progress kill; the quiet-phase UI warning is suppressed while a tool is
  legitimately running inside its effective budget and shows the budget on
  the live tool line.

### Changed
  The recommended parallel-orchestration companion is now **pinned**
  `pi-subagents@0.62.0` — the power-max choice for GLLA. GLLA tracks its
  versioned `subagent:*` lifecycle, durable async status artifacts, and v1
  stop RPC while retaining a bounded compatibility path for older providers.
  The model settings surface now uses the current `scout`/`researcher`/
  `worker`/`reviewer`/`oracle`/`delegate` roles; current built-ins inherit
  the parent model by default. Do not stack `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` or
  `@quintinshaw/pi-dynamic-workflows` as a second orchestrator alongside it.
  See `audit/SUBAGENT-PACKAGE-SELECTION-2026-09-01.md` (five-package power audit).

### Fixed
  Completed standalone goals now hand off to an already-waiting list and arm
  the same bounded completion-settle window used by list-item cascades. The
  explicit `/glla resume` surface now hydrates and starts a waiting-only queue,
  while aborts, loop ownership, suspicious-objective, sidecar, and persistence
  fences remain intact. Waiting-list cards name `/glla resume` as the recovery
  action and retain `/list next` for deliberate skip/selection.

  Durable state transitions and deferred settle repaints now bypass the
  periodic UI throttle, while unchanged activity/ticker updates remain
  cadence-limited. A replacement host therefore gets its first paint and
  meaningful durable status changes cannot remain visually stale.

  Detached-auditor payload blocks now escape XML-like delimiters in goal,
  completion, verification, and shield data so untrusted text cannot close a
  prompt boundary or impersonate prompt structure.

  TUI jitter under scout fan-out is fixed: the above-editor widget now shows
  only the compact one-line summary `● N agents · <busiest> silent Xm`
  (bucketed 5s/<1m, 15s/<5m, 30s otherwise) instead of splicing 2 lines per
  scout into the card. Detailed per-agent rows remain in `/glla agents` and
  `--tail` as designed (docs/DESIGN-subagent-visibility.md), so height no
  longer swings 4→10 lines and the editor layout stays stable under
  `scout x3` / 150+ tool-use fan-outs.

  Recovery and session-handoff freshness now rejects future-dated sidecars,
  preventing an edited or clock-skewed marker from triggering an unexpected
  resume or deferred-list replay.

  Tracked child transcript tails use the persisted session id for direct
  lookup, so older children remain inspectable without an unbounded directory
  scan. List-audit fan-out now reads the configured state root, including
  `sessionDir`, instead of assuming `<cwd>/.pi-glla`.

## 0.36.1 — crash-safe persistence and packed-release verification (2026-08-31)

### Fixed
  Terminal archival now records a durable intent before publication and
  reconciles interrupted archive/state commits on startup, preventing a
  published archive from resurrecting an active goal or permanently fencing
  the next archive attempt.

  Destructive queue operations now fail closed when sidecar cleanup cannot be
  proven successful. List clear/cancel/remove, group close, carryover, wipe,
  and repair-source consumption preserve recoverable durable work instead of
  mutating memory and allowing a failed deletion to reappear after restart.

  The active ledger now rotates into immutable, ownership-fenced segments and
  keeps a complete current-state snapshot in the active file. Startup recovery
  handles the rename-before-rewrite interruption window while forensic history
  remains available.

  Bounded scanners and streaming reducers now back list depth, log tails,
  switch logs, postaudit cadence, and multi-project statistics. Detached
  auditor scratch now has a read-only health report plus age-bounded cleanup
  limited to worker identities proven dead; ambiguous directories remain
  untouched.

  The runtime-global bridge now has one compile-checked registration registry
  and typed high-risk lifecycle fields, reducing silent name and shape drift.

### Changed
  `release:check` now packs, installs, and imports the actual npm tarball in a
  temporary directory, including the shipped goal entry point and auditor
  launcher/worker paths. No registry publish is performed by the smoke.

## 0.36.0 — event-driven long-running supervision (2026-08-28)

### Added
  Bare `/goal start`, `/loop start`, and `/list start` now use a bounded active
  branch context window only when it contains one clear actionable user
  request. Ambiguous, generic, truncated, or multi-task context returns to the
  existing drafting/confirmation flow; list queue activation and loop metric
  settings remain explicit.

  GLLA now records a six-label user-facing recap for every archived terminal
  objective and loop stop. Valid recaps are preserved; missing or incomplete
  claims receive a recorded-facts-only fallback with explicit `not recorded`
  values instead of invented evidence.

  The shared heartbeat is now an event-first continuous supervisor across
  goals, list items, loops, auditors, subagents, provider recovery, and queue
  state. It reacts to lifecycle/durable signals immediately and uses adaptive
  fallback polling rather than guessed task-duration waits.

### Fixed
  Detached completion-auditor failures now coordinate RPC stdout EOF with the
  child process close, preserving bounded exit code, signal, stderr, and
  malformed-stream diagnostics while remaining fail-closed until
  `agent_settled`.

### Changed
  The detached auditor now has the same ordered, deselectable, bounded fallback
  chain as the main agent (`auditorModelFallbacks`, up to 10 refs), with the
  former singular fallback setting migrated compatibly. An unset auditor
  thinking level inherits the parent session's live dial, including `max`,
  while explicit auditor levels remain overrides.

  Aggressive recovery retries recoverable provider/host/auditor failures across
  arbitrary durations with bounded per-attempt backoff. Ordinary auditor
  objections become durable TODOs; repeated identical objections with no new
  progress stop on a state-based decision boundary. Conservative mode retains
  its bounded recovery horizon.

  Full auditor `IMPOSSIBLE` results and list auto-drops now pass through the
  terminal archive fence with durable recaps; partial impossible results keep
  their explicit narrowing behavior. Every loop-stop notification includes a
  compact projection of the generated six-label recap. Version-bearing
  already-shipped claims, explicit goal/list cancellation, and `/glla wipe`
  now include the same compact projection in their terminal notifications.

  Detached-auditor first-event watchdogs start at worker spawn rather than
  charging dispatch setup time, with a runtime-compatible return-time fallback;
  cancellation waits for worker teardown before classifying the attempt. The
  former unconditional auditor wall is compatibility metadata only; active
  output, tool, durable, and child progress can continue until a result,
  confirmed-silence watchdog, per-tool timeout, or explicit lifecycle stop.

  Carryover replacement, `/list next` skips, and complete-without-audit now
  check the archive fence before reporting success and include the same recap
  projection as other terminal paths. Continuous-supervision tests now drive
  durable state transitions and lifecycle signals across every declared plane.

  Validation warnings are metadata rather than recap fields: an incomplete
  claim whose NOTE mentions label names is still replaced by the recorded-
  facts-only archive fallback. Approved terminal notifications use the same
  six-label compact projection, including for long valid recaps, instead of a
  raw flattened slice.

  Durable-vs-defer decisions now have an explicit `record_goal_judgment` tool:
  inline and deferred choices are persisted as bounded ledger events, with a
  required durable follow-up for intentional deferrals. The policy keeps the
  durable action ahead of defer and pins the plaque-ordering regression.
  The recommendation now comes from a typed semantic decision path, including
  the three-defer case, and the active goal card has a deterministic ordered
  plaque fixture so UI ordering is tested rather than inferred from prose.
  `record_goal_judgment` now persists bounded recommendation facts on the goal
  and immediately routes them through production `refreshUI()`; the production
  integration test captures the resulting durable-first card.

  See `docs/DESIGN-long-running-supervision.md` for the durable policy and
  future decision checklist.

## 0.35.72 — remove duplicate terminal outcome widget (2026-08-28)

### Fixed
  Approved or aborted goals now clear the live outcome slot after the single
  completion notification. The archived goal record and ledger remain the
  durable history, while legacy `lastOutcome` state is read safely but no
  longer paints a second `✓ done` row after archival.

### Tests
  Updated terminal-outcome regressions to verify that completed/aborted goals
  leave no retained widget row, while live goals still outrank legacy state.

## 0.35.71 — bounded Pi-core retry containment (2026-08-26)

### Changed
  GLLA now exposes a configurable zero-stream retry budget (default 3,
  allowed range 0–10). When Pi remains BUSY without stream activity, GLLA
  still aborts and durably parks the owner, then re-dispatches repeatedly
  within that finite budget before requiring explicit resume. A real stream
  starts a fresh budget; supervisor pause, generation fences, and durable
  recovery semantics remain intact. This contains the Pi-core retry-sleeper
  failure at GLLA's public boundary without modifying Pi or any other plugin.

### Tests
  Added repeated-silence exhaustion, budget persistence/validation, settings
  menu/editor coverage, and existing lifecycle/park/no-storm regressions.

## 0.35.70 — optional-provider boundary and recovery alignment (2026-08-26)

### Changed
  GLLA now delegates the managed subagent agent-directory lookup to pi's
  host resolver, honoring custom `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` values instead of
  assuming `~/.pi/agent`. The core extension remains independent of the
  optional `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` provider.

### Tests
  Added a genuine no-provider load smoke test that forbids the optional
  provider import while loading the extension, plus custom-agent-directory
  coverage. The existing context-overflow recovery path remains the single
  configured fallback route; no hardcoded free model was introduced.

## 0.35.69 — metricless-loop cadence (2026-08-26)

### Added
  Metricless and measured loops accept an opt-in `cadence=<seconds>` minimum
  interval between successful automatic iterations. The cadence is persisted,
  shown in `/loop status` and loop prompts, and explicit starts/resumes bypass
  it for an urgent wake. The default remains unchanged.

### Tests
  Coverage verifies cadence parsing, delayed automatic re-wakes, urgent
  explicit starts, and the existing unbounded metricless behavior.

## 0.35.68 — bound-stop recovery (2026-08-26)

### Fixed
  Explicit `/loop resume` now recovers time- and token-bound stops as fresh
  supervised windows without discarding iteration, history, or best-value
  state. Recoverable stopped loops can accept a confirmed
  `propose_loop_refine` change while remaining stopped until explicitly
  resumed. Clean max-iteration and finished loops remain terminal; automatic
  startup does not silently reset an explicit budget.

### Tests
  Coverage verifies fresh time windows, token-budget resets, preserved loop
  history, stopped-loop refinement, and the unchanged max-iteration guard.

## 0.35.67 — in-band provider-result recovery (2026-08-26)

### Fixed
  Repeated successful tool transports that carry a strong 503/429/network
  provider pane no longer enter loop stuck or plateau accounting as ordinary
  work. After the same tool/result fingerprint repeats, the turn is routed
  through the existing provider-recovery envelope; one-off status text in a
  searched document remains ordinary output.

### Tests
  Coverage spans provider-marker classification, repeated-pane detection,
  loop-turn exemption, durable recovery parking, and the unchanged real-error
  and repetition paths. The full release gate remains green.

## 0.35.66 — compiled-host auditor launcher (2026-08-26)

### Fixed
  Detached completion audits no longer launch the worker with a compiled Pi
  executable. The process layer preserves explicit runtime overrides, keeps
  Node/Node.js/Bun/Deno `process.execPath` values, and falls back to `node` for
  compiled hosts that would otherwise parse worker flags such as `--job-dir`.

### Tests
  Runtime-resolution coverage includes Unix, Windows, Node.js aliases, Bun,
  Deno, compiled Pi paths, and bare executable names. The existing explicit
  runtime-override transport regression remains covered.

## 0.35.65 — status surfaces and worker liveness (2026-08-26)

### Added
  The persistent footer now stays compact and global, while the detailed
  widget and `/glla agents` share one evidence-backed worker projection. Active
  non-auditor workers expose sanitized identity/purpose, queued/running/hung/
  ended status, coarse phase, elapsed time, silence age, and ownership-aware
  lifecycle evidence. Narrow widgets retain essential liveness fields and
  point explicitly to `/glla agents` when rows overflow.

### Changed
  Detached completion-auditor evidence remains a separate verification HUD;
  it is not mixed into the worker roster or duplicated in the global footer.
  Existing command names, lifecycle, persistence, recovery, and auditor
  semantics are unchanged.

### Tests
  Focused status and worker-lifecycle coverage, fresh active/queue/recovery/
  auditor fixtures, the full release gate, TypeScript checking, offline auditor
  validation, and npm packaging were completed for this release.

## 0.35.64 — bounded recovery for frozen subagents (2026-08-25)

### Fix
  A tracked top-level subagent that produces no tool-use or output-token
  progress now receives the existing short warning first, then one
  generation-fenced child-specific abort request after the configurable
  `subagentHangEscalationMinutes` threshold (default 30; 0 keeps
  warning/telemetry-only behavior). Nested, unreachable, or ownership-
  ambiguous children remain warning-only. A stale child no longer shields an
  unrelated parent zombie watchdog, and `/glla agents` shows ABORTING,
  unavailable, or failed action state while preserving partial output.

### Tests
  `tests/subagent-hang-detection.test.ts` covers one-shot escalation,
  progress-before-action cancellation, manager-unavailable and nested-child
  safety, and `tests/agents-panel.test.ts` pins the action surface. Settings
  menu/editor and INSTALL documentation expose the new threshold.

### Follow-up hardening
  Frozen-child escalation now uses pi-subagents' existing root-session
  `subagents:rpc:stop` bridge, with readiness, ownership, generation, and
  timeout-race fencing. The real AgentManager/RPC path is covered by a
  deterministic pending-provider integration test without modifying the
  upstream package.

  Malformed saved goal/list objectives now produce a bounded repair/replan
  card instead of a self-blocking first turn. One durable bootstrap turn
  carries the complete preserved target and `propose_task_list` confirmation;
  automatic repeats are fenced, while explicit `/list resume` re-arms one
  retry. The card keeps its concrete recovery action and queue position
  visible.

### Tests
  Focused repair/replan, display, stale-probe, and RPC regressions are
  included in the release contract. The complete gate remains the source of
  truth for the published artifact.

## 0.35.63 — auditor context held until resume (2026-08-25)

### Fix
  Cold session restores now keep unfinished goal/list objectives and their
  status visible without automatically injecting the previous auditor report
  or dispatching a new continuation. Explicit `/goal resume`, list/glla/loop
  continuation commands, validated lifecycle continuity, and global
  `autoResume: true` release the auditor-context gate. The prior Pi transcript
  and durable audit history remain untouched.

### Tests
  `tests/auditor-blank-until-resume.test.ts` proves objective visibility,
  pre-consent report/TODO suppression, explicit resume release, auto-resume
  release, and rejected stale-resume suppression. Version metadata is
  synchronized to 0.35.63.

### Follow-up hardening
  `/goal resume` now releases the auditor surface only after its existing
  stale/foreign admission probe. Active-idle resumes receive the same probe;
  stale paused resumes preserve the existing active/interrupted recovery
  marker without exposing old auditor context. Main-model recovery resumes
  now use the same stale/foreign admission probe and release the surface on
  manual-hold, retry, and primary-probe recovery paths; a recovery regression
  test pins the consent behavior.

## 0.35.62 — subagent host-state boundary (2026-08-25)

### Fix
  Headless child sessions are now rejected before state-root registration,
  restore, owner claims, and tool repair. The same fail-closed boundary covers
  persistent children, foreign slash commands, and missing tool invocation
  contexts. File-backed host successors remain eligible for legitimate reload
  and silent-rebind recovery. Main-host subagent telemetry continues through
  the event bus and `/glla agents` path.

### Tests
  `tests/subagent-host-boundary.test.ts` proves first-claim prevention,
  foreign slash-command refusal, persistent-worker refusal, legitimate host
  successor admission, and durable Explore telemetry. Version metadata is
  synchronized to 0.35.62.

## 0.35.61 — list queue visibility across host replacement (2026-08-25)

### Fix
  Waiting-only list state now has an actionable status/widget projection even
  when no list item is active. Silent host-successor and same-session stale
  recovery boundaries also re-read the selected durable root and hydrate queue
  sidecars before repainting. A recovered queue now stays visible and can be
  started with `/list next` without requiring a full reload.

### Tests
  `tests/list-invisible-restart.test.ts` covers waiting-only visibility and
  activation plus sidecar-only silent-successor rehydration. Version metadata
  is synchronized to 0.35.61.

## 0.35.60 — pre-turn glla tool visibility (2026-08-25)

### Fix
  GLLA agent tools are now registered and reactivated immediately before
  agent turns, with `agent_start`/`turn_start` compatibility fallbacks. This
  closes the interval where an external tool allowlist or modlist could remove
  `pause_goal` after session restore and Pi would answer a valid model call
  with `Tool pause_goal not found`, leaving a parked objective looking stuck
  until reload.

### Tests
  `tests/gettick-tool-visibility.test.ts` simulates a post-restore active-tool
  replacement and verifies the pre-turn boundary restores `pause_goal` and
  keeps it callable. Version metadata is synchronized to 0.35.60.

## 0.35.59 — safe cancel/wipe across unresolved session roots (2026-08-25)

### Fix
  `/glla cancel`, `/glla wipe`, `/list cancel`, `/list clear`, and the shared
  goal archive path now fail closed while opt-in `sessionDir` resolution is
  pending. They leave the in-memory objective/list untouched and do not
  recreate or mutate an ambiguous cwd state tree; after host lifecycle
  admission registers the session root, cancel and wipe archive/clear under
  the selected session root as before.

### Tests
  `tests/objective-loss-lifecycle.test.ts` covers both deferred destructive
  commands and successful `/glla cancel` + `/glla wipe` cleanup under a
  registered session root. Version metadata is synchronized to 0.35.59.

## 0.35.58 — objective-loss lifecycle repair (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  Wired the opt-in `sessionDir` root into the admitted production lifecycle.
  `session_start` and silent host-successor admission now register Pi's
  canonical `SessionManager.getSessionDir()` before owner, invalidation, or
  restore writes; in-memory worker sessions remain pending instead of creating
  an ambiguous cwd tree. The configured session directory wins over an
  imported session-file parent, while `PI_SESSION_FILE` remains the explicit
  child-process fallback.

### Evidence
  Added `tests/objective-loss-lifecycle.test.ts`: a real registered
  `session_start` handler proves production root registration, and separate
  fresh Bun writer/reader processes recover an objective across a cwd switch.
  The report intentionally does not claim to simulate a crash mid-write or a
  specific version migration. Full evidence:
  audit/OBJECTIVE-LOSS-VALIDATION-2026-08-24.md.

### Tests
  Focused lifecycle/state-root tests and clean tsc pass; the full release gate
  is run for this version before closure.

## 0.35.57 — objective-loss validation (2026-08-24)

### Evidence
  Validated the Now report that objectives disappeared after a Wez crash or
  version/cwd switch. The historical workingDir default intentionally makes a
  cwd switch select a different on-disk root, while explicit sessionDir keeps
  the objective visible across cwd changes. Pending session-root resolution
  does not migrate or delete the old cwd tree. The bounded result was
  evidence-based closure pending production lifecycle wiring; crash-only loss
  was not reproduced. The subsequent gettick, list-reload, and
  subagent-visibility reports remain separate items.
  Full evidence: audit/OBJECTIVE-LOSS-VALIDATION-2026-08-24.md.
## 0.35.56 — state-root consumer/lifecycle hardening (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  Hardened every remaining state-root consumer and lifecycle boundary missed
  by the core/settings slice. Raw `<cwd>/.pi-glla` joins in auditor jobs,
  dispatch, goal-loop ledger reads, reviewer, stats rollup/discovery, and
  session owner/handoff/pending-list paths now route through `piGlaDir` and
  respect the selected root. Pending `sessionDir` resolution (no session dir
  yet) is a strict deferral: dispatch, reviewer, session owner, handoff, and
  pending-list writes return a deferred/false result without creating a
  fallback `<cwd>/.pi-glla` tree, and legacy `.pi-gla` trees are still never
  migrated. Audit-loop open-count helpers now resolve via the selected root
  as well. Host/subagent ownership stays per-process via `PI_SESSION_FILE`
  fallback and the explicit `setRuntimeSessionDir` hook — no global overwrite.

### Tests
  New `tests/state-root-consumers.test.ts` pins resolved-root routing for
  dispatch/stats/audit helpers, pending deferral for dispatch/reviewer, the
  `PI_SESSION_FILE` fallback, and source-level absence of raw hardcodings plus
  pending guards. Existing `tests/state-root.test.ts` continues to cover core
  core/settings behavior. Red/green: breaking the `piGlaDir` routing makes the
  consumer pins fail; restoring passes 9/9 focused plus 56 prior. tsc and full
  release gate green for this tree.
## 0.35.55 — opt-in session-root state core/settings slice (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  Ported the valid state-root portion of PR #21 onto current main without
  merging the stale PR verbatim. New dependency-free
  extensions/glla-state-root.ts owns the typed global root selector and
  session-directory resolution so goal-loop-core can select a root without a
  settings import cycle. The historical <cwd>/.pi-glla workingDir remains
  the default; sessionDir is explicit opt-in and resolves to the top-level Pi
  session directory (or PI_SESSION_FILE's parent for worker processes).
  Session-root mode is global-only because project settings.json lives inside
  the selected root. Pending sessionDir resolution is a write boundary:
  core directory/ledger/queue/sentinel/audit-log writes defer rather than
  recreate an ambiguous cwd tree, and old .pi-gla/.pi-glla trees are never
  migrated or deleted by the new mode. The settings menu exposes the two
  choices and project attempts to override stateRoot are stripped.

### Tests
  tests/state-root.test.ts covers default cwd persistence, opt-in session-root
  persistence, pending-write/no-migration behavior, PI_SESSION_FILE fallback,
  and global-only settings round-trip. settings-editors and
  settings-menu-complete pin the UI/provenance surface; the long-term
  preferences boundary now checks the dependency-free global path owner.
  Red/green proved the session-root branch is required (2 of 5 focused tests
  fail when neutered; restored 5/5). tsc and focused tests pass before the
  full release gate.
## 0.35.54 — RESUMABLE_STOP honors the v0.35.31 "metric never moved" stop (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  Collect-pass HIGH finding: the v0.35.31 "metric never moved" stop reason
  promises "/loop resume retries or /loop stop" in its own message, but the
  RESUMABLE_STOP predicate in /loop resume never matched that prefix - the
  promised command answered "No held loop to resume", and with
  propose_loop_refine gated on an ACTIVE loop, the only recovery was
  /loop stop + a fresh start discarding iteration history. Same class as
  the v0.35.25 issue-#14 zombie prefix bug (fixed there for zero-stream,
  missed for this brand-new prefix). The prefix is now resumable: resuming
  re-arms the error/stuck/stall counters while preserving iteration, best,
  and history; if the metric is still dead it re-stops loudly after its
  window, and a measure-changing propose_loop_refine (usable again once
  resumed) re-scopes the measure era so the never-moved grace re-arms.

### Tests
  tests/metric-never-moved-resumable.test.ts: behavioral - a loop parked by
  the exact production reason string resumes via /loop resume with
  iteration/best/history preserved and all three streak counters re-armed;
  negative pin - a bounded stop ("max iterations reached") stays
  non-resumable. Red-proven by removing the predicate clause (behavioral
  fails, negative pin stays green).
## 0.35.53 — false repair card after abort+reload: parser marker fix + contract-derived objective heal (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  note.md Now: "objective needs repair issue, but before reload it looked
  fine". Field forensics (neonbreak, item 20260823082852-in3rc7): the list
  draft batch wrote an item with objective "" and the ENTIRE intent inside
  the verification contract - extractVerificationContract's line marker
  regex `verify\b[^:]*:` misread the imperative sentence "Verify the
  shipped PREMIUM-UIUX pass (...): confirm ..." as a contract marker
  ("verify" is both a marker word and an ordinary imperative verb), leaving
  the objective empty. The activation gate then correctly flagged "empty"
  and jammed a repair card ahead of the item - 42
  faulty_objective_list_activation_blocked events over 22 hours, an endless
  repair-card loop that wedged the session. Two-layer durable fix:
  (1) WRITER - the line marker for the ambiguous verbs now requires the
  colon immediately ("Verify:" / "Verify when:" / "Verification:");
  "done"/"done when"/"verified when" keep a bounded 60-char decorated-marker
  gap so prose tails cannot masquerade as markers either. The field text
  now parses with the real objective and only the grep tail as contract.
  (2) READER - legacy items already persisted with an empty objective plus
  a clean, actionable contract derive their objective deterministically
  from the contract's leading imperative sentence at activation
  (list_objective_derived_from_contract) instead of demanding a repair
  card. Empty objective + absent or suspicious contract still takes the
  true broken-objective repair path, unchanged.

### Tests
  tests/false-repair-card.test.ts: the exact field text parses with its
  intent in the objective; short-marker and decorated-marker forms still
  parse; derivation unit rules (first sentence, suspicious/non-imperative
  contracts rejected); behavioral - a legacy stuck item activates with the
  derived objective (no repair demand, contract preserved), a truly broken
  item still triggers the repair card, and a fresh /list add of the field
  text activates directly end-to-end. Red-proven by neutering both layers
  (4 of 6 fail; the true-broken-path tests stay green).
## 0.35.52 — context hygiene: era-scope failed error-only turns out of the effective context (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  note.md Now: "failed requests add to the context, while clearly adding
  nothing of value". When retries are exhausted, the failed assistant turn
  (stopReason "error", errorMessage set, content empty/partial) STAYS in
  agent state and the session - pi strips it from live state only for
  mid-flight retries. Every later LLM call receives it and compaction
  summarizes it; nothing downstream filters these. Field evidence (polis,
  2026-08-23): a run of 503/network_error/retry-cancelled turns drove the
  estimated context to 122.7% of the 200k window, and auto-compaction then
  aborted on its own bloated summarization input. New
  extensions/context-hygiene.ts: a durable bounded rule drops error-only
  assistant turns (stopReason "error", NO tool-call blocks) from the
  effective context EXCEPT the most recent one, which stays so the model
  sees why the previous attempt failed on the retry send. Applied at two
  points: the `context` event projection (per-send, transcript untouched -
  alongside the v0.35.51 payload guard) and `session_before_compact`
  (prunes the shared preparation object the compaction runner summarizes,
  shrinking the summarizer request and keeping failures out of the summary).
  Tool-call-carrying error turns own paired toolResults and stay intact;
  "aborted" turns are user-intent boundaries and are never touched. Drops
  are ledgered (context_hygiene_dropped / context_hygiene_compaction_input).

### Tests
  tests/context-hygiene.test.ts: predicate (tool-carrying/aborted/healthy
  never droppable); bounded drop rule (newest kept, older dropped, identity
  preserved at/under the window, configurable window); seeded bloat (60
  failures collapse, normal turns survive verbatim); in-place compaction
  preparation pruning; behavioral wiring through MockPi for both hooks with
  ledger assertions and clean-history no-op. Red-proven by neutering both
  production call sites.
## 0.35.51 — payload guard: bound inline image bytes on every outgoing LLM call (2026-08-24)

### Fix
  note.md Now: "req body too large due to images in context". Generated
  images accumulate in conversation history as inline base64 blocks until
  the provider rejects the request with 413 ("Downloaded image content
  cannot exceed 30MB" / "Request Entity Too Large") - and every
  main-model-recovery probe re-sent the same bloated history, so recovery
  could never classify or heal the failure; the session was wedged until a
  manual restart WITHOUT history. Two-layer durable fix: (1) a new
  extensions/payload-guard.ts projects the outgoing message list at the pi
  `context` event (fired before EVERY LLM call), bounding cumulative
  inline-image bytes to 16MB - evicting the OLDEST images first, always
  keeping the newest two, replacing each evicted block with a short text
  placeholder. Disk history is untouched (per-send projection), and the
  chokepoint protects ordinary turns AND recovery probes alike. Evictions
  are ledgered as payload_guard_eviction. (2) classifyMainModelFailure now
  maps 413/payload-size texts to "transient" - retryable in place, because
  the payload guard (not a fallback-model switch) heals the size; the old
  "unknown" classification burned the whole chain on useless rotations.

### Tests
  tests/payload-guard.test.ts: under-budget pass-through (same identity);
  oldest-first eviction with newest-two floor; floor holds when the budget
  cannot be met; idempotent projection, non-image content untouched;
  behavioral wiring (context handler projects + ledgeres; under-budget
  passes unprojected); 413 texts classify transient (not unknown, not
  context-overflow). Red-proven by neutering both production sites.
## 0.35.50 — same-process session successors auto-resume the main thread (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  note.md Now #2: session-start auto-resume asymmetry. The v0.35.23 loop
  branch treats a SAME-PROCESS session successor (shutdown recorded in the
  owner sidecar with a non-quit reason, previous pid === current pid) as
  mid-flight continuity and resumes held loops - but a plain ACTIVE goal
  held ("restored on session load - held for explicit resume") and a parked
  completion-audit claim stayed parked in that exact corner: from the
  user's seat, the list kept going after the session replacement while the
  goal sat "awaiting first turn". The goal restore gate and the auditor
  claim's canRecoverNow now accept the same consent, refined per the
  v0.34.49 one-shot identity law: a PRESENT handoff marker is authoritative
  even when mismatched (rejection holds); only an ABSENT marker with a
  same-pid non-quit shutdown is continuity - the same distinction
  listOperationLifecycleResume already draws. Different-pid crash
  successors and cold loads still hold for an explicit decision;
  Auto-resume stays the only load-time automation for them.

### Tests
  tests/same-process-successor-resume.test.ts: same-process successor
  resumes a held ACTIVE goal (continuation dispatched, no stale interrupt
  marker); same-process successor auto-retries a parked completion claim
  (audit_recovery_auto_retry_claimed fence in the ledger); different-pid
  crash successor still HOLDS (cold-load law). Red-proven by neutering
  both consent sites; the v0.34.49 mismatched-marker identity test stays
  green against the refined consent.
## 0.35.49 — parent-side silence watchdogs close the auditor-AWOL gap (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Field evidence across five projects (football-forever, doomtap,
  junk-runner, email-api-compare, vps-compare): a detached auditor worker
  whose provider hangs emits ONE boot RPC event (or none) and then total
  silence. The v0.34.57 no-progress watchdog only arms while heartbeats
  stay FRESH, so a stale heartbeat disarmed it, the worker's own stall
  brake was the only other bound, and every doomed attempt burned its full
  30m wall while the goal sat "auditing" and the queue looked dead. The
  poll loop now owns two complementary silence axes with the same
  running-tool exemption: heartbeat-stale (had an event, went silent for
  the window) and first-event-timeout (never emitted anything within
  firstEventTimeoutMs, a new runtime knob defaulting to the same window).
  Both demote the HUD to quiet, emit auditor_stalled, terminate the
  worker, and return retryable "timeout" infra - which the existing
  fallback ladder re-drives with its eager 5s first retry instead of the
  wall.

### Tests
  tests/auditor-stall-watchdog.test.ts: three workers (silent since boot,
  one-boot-heartbeat-then-silence, tool-open-silent) prove both axes fail
  fast BEFORE the wall, classify as retryable infra, SIGTERM the worker,
  and remove the job scratch; the third pins the running-tool exemption.
  Red-proven against pre-change code: both stall runs burned the full
  wall and never stalled. tests/auditor-process.test.ts heartbeat test
  disarms the new axis (firstEventTimeoutMs) to isolate its own.
## 0.35.48 — overdue-wait backstop respects the dispatch-surface gates (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: overdueWaitBackstop mutated durable state (parked to
  active, pauseResumeAt cleared) without checking the
  extensionApiStale/sessionHandoffPending/stale-terminal or
  mainModelRecoveryActive gates - during a latched-stale heartbeat a
  durably parked wait could become an ACTIVE goal with no dispatch until a
  fresh session_start, breaking the paused-is-safe invariant. The backstop
  now refuses mid-handoff and stale-latched windows, and under an active
  main-model recovery releases ONLY recovery-routed waits (the probe route
  re-parks with a fresh resumeAt on failure) - unrelated agent-authored
  waits stay parked until recovery resolves. The gates sit BEFORE the
  lastOverdueWaitKey one-shot latch so skipped windows stay retriable.

## 0.35.47 — completions/handler parity for /list and /loop verbs (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: verbs handled by the dispatchers but absent from the
  subcommand completions - /list add|import|rm (and pause, caught while
  pinning), and /loop resume|refine|polish. All seven now appear in their
  getArgumentCompletions tables with accurate descriptions. A generic
  parity pin in tests/command-registration-collisions.test.ts scans every
  `sub === "x"` dispatch literal inside cmdList/cmdLoop and fails when a
  handled verb has no completion entry - future verbs cannot ship
  half-registered.

## 0.35.46 — /glla agents --tail sanitization + bounded scan reads (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding, two parts: (1) child-transcript tail lines were
  rendered through ctx.ui.notify WITHOUT ANSI/control-character
  sanitization - unlike every other external-text projection - so a
  hostile child transcript could emit terminal escape sequences;
  formatTranscriptEntry now runs all output paths (both [raw] fallbacks
  and the [role] text path) through sanitizeDisplayText. (2) The candidate
  scan synchronously read up to 25 FULL transcript files on the main
  thread; the reader contract now takes an optional maxBytes and the
  production command passes a real partial tail read (256 KiB window,
  TRANSCRIPT_SCAN_MAX_BYTES), so the scan touches at most the last 256 KiB
  of each candidate. The single matched file still gets a full read so the
  "last N of M" detail stays honest.

## 0.35.45 — plan-mode seeded hint separator (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: planNote ended "...than a regular draft." and was
  concatenated directly with the label hint, producing
  "...regular draft.Goal drafting - deep planning: ..." in the notified
  seeded hint. The join is now explicit (planNote ? `${planNote} ` : "").
  Behavioral test drives the real /goal plan command with a seed and
  asserts the notified hint reads "regular draft. Goal drafting - deep
  planning:"; proven red with the glued concatenation restored.

## 0.35.44 — draftingDepth dead state removed; orphaned-gate windows closed (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding, three parts: (1) the draftingDepth runtime global was
  write-only dead state - set in startDrafting, reset in clearDraftingState,
  zero readers (template selection uses the depth parameter) - removed
  outright; "no target => normal depth" now holds by construction, so no
  consumer can observe stale depth across proposal-completion paths.
  (2) The two bare `draftingTarget = null` completion paths that skipped the
  drafter-model restore (batch-activation conflict refusal, zombie-twin
  rejection) now restore like every other exit. (3) beginDrafterModel moved
  inside a try that clears the drafting gate on throw - a throw used to
  leave the orphaned gate startDrafting's own header warns about.

## 0.35.43 — refine re-baselines specChecked with the spec write (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: refine's orchestrator-side spec write updated
  specHash but not loop.specChecked, so the next tick saw checked >
  specChecked against the OLD file's count and ledged spec_item_progress
  attributed to the agent's iteration - unearned progress feeding the
  multi-signal stuck gate (the user confirmed the respec; the agent may
  have done nothing). The refine handler now re-baselines specChecked
  together with specHash after writing the new spec.

## 0.35.42 — measure-era scoping for loop movement accounting (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: applyRefinement re-baselines best/last/stall on a
  measure-changing refine but keeps history, so OLD-era improved entries
  made both movement checks permanently true for the NEW metric era - the
  v0.35.31 flat-reading grace could never apply after a measure-changing
  refine, and a dead new metric could never earn its never-moved stop.
  applyMeasurement now scopes metricHasMoved and metricNeverMoved to the
  current measure era (history after the last measure-changing
  refinement's iteration; the boundary was already recorded on every
  LoopRefinement). Two twin tests proven red without the scoping, green
  with it.

## 0.35.41 — the last two loop-stop routes announce queue resumption (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: v0.35.22's "ends by ANY route ... ANNOUNCE loudly"
  contract was only wired into some stop routes. The stuck-ladder stop and
  the provider-error/abort-cap stop notified the loop line but never
  announced that waiting list items can start again - a dead silent entry.
  Both routes now call announceQueuedListAfterLoopEnd (exported from
  goal-loop.ts for the goal-activation site). Two twin behavioral tests
  drive each production route against a seeded waiting queue; both proven
  red with their call neutered, green restored.

## 0.35.40 — regression pins for the audit-kind measurement exemption (2026-08-23)

### Tests
  Audit-pass finding: commit 28131527's audit-kind exemption in
  applyMeasurement shipped with zero regression pin. Two twin-loop tests in
  tests/loop-forever.test.ts now pin it: (1) identical flat-metric shapes
  diverge by kind - the audit loop counts every flat toward plateau from
  iteration 1 while the non-audit loop's pre-movement flats stay free;
  (2) a dead metric gets the dedicated "metric never moved" stop on plain
  loops but never on audit loops, whose final verdict stays plateau.
  Red/green proven: deleting both halves of guard one fails both twins;
  the never-moved kind-guard proved unreachable-by-construction for audits
  (plateau always returns first) and is pinned in source instead.

## 0.35.39 — README Files map is actually complete (2026-08-23)

### Docs
  Audit-pass finding: the Files map showed 4 of 7 prompts (missing both
  plan-draft prompts shipped in v0.35.33 and goal-loop-forever-metricless)
  and ~19 of 44 extensions files while reading as complete. The map now
  enumerates every file - 34 extensions/ + 10 loops/ + 7 prompts/ + all
  scripts/ - grouped by concern, with one-line descriptions verified
  against each module's exports.

# 0.35.38 — README verb-semantics documentation (2026-08-23)

### Docs
  User-requested audit finding: what /goal|/list|/loop audit MEAN vs start
  vs the plan verbs lived only in code comments. New "What the verbs mean"
  table right after the quick-start block (audit is deliberately three
  machines: one-shot fix-in-pass goal, collect-then-drain list item,
  forever cadence loop; plan = extended draft on all surfaces; verify
  audits the CURRENT goal, not the project), the drafting-rules paragraph
  now names plan as the fourth depth, and "Which loop?" cross-links it.
  Includes the DECIDED semantics: /list plan takes prose only — a file
  path stays bulk import; files mentioned inside /list plan are research
  input, never auto-imported.

## 0.35.37 — recovery welcome-back notice now fires exactly once (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: autoResumedAt/autoResumedEvent were set by three
  auto-recovery sites (heartbeat overdue-wait backstop, main-model provider
  recovery, auditor provider retry) but the ONLY clearing site was MANUAL
  resume — so the continuation prompt injected the "WELCOME BACK, YOU WERE
  RECOVERED" directive into EVERY dispatch of a goal that kept running days
  after one recovery. The accepted-dispatch site in sendContinuation now
  marks the notice delivered: the stamp clears and a
  recovery_notice_delivered ledger entry records it, so the directive is
  injected exactly once per auto-resume. Manual /goal resume keeps its own
  clearing (user-driven, no notice needed).

## 0.35.36 — complete_goal newObjective no longer launders agent text into userSeeds (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: the newObjective branch appended the AGENT-authored
  objective to objectiveProvenance.userSeeds; since createdVia stays "user"
  from creation, the v0.35.31 seed trust then treated that agent-written
  text as explicit user prose and dispatched it verbatim past the
  suspicious-objective fence. userSeeds is now strictly human-confirmed
  text (creation arg, /goal tweak Confirm dialog, repair-redraft task-list
  confirm); a newObjective pivot is recorded via its goal_tweaked ledger
  entry and reviewed by the isolated auditor against the NEW contract in
  the same call. Regression test proves red-on-laundering /
  green-on-fix; behavioral consequence observed: heuristic-tripping pivots
  on user goals now flow through the normal fence (auto-restore from the
  durable original) instead of being waved through.

## 0.35.35 — user-seed trust works with contract clauses and role markers (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: v0.35.31's seed trust compared the CLEANED
  goal.objective against RAW stored seeds by exact equality — but createGoal
  strips "Done when:" clauses and Agent:/Role: declarations out of the
  objective while keeping the raw arg as the seed, so any seeded goal WITH a
  clause/role silently no-op'd the trust and still parked behind the
  suspicious-objective heuristic. New pure helper objectiveIsUserSeeded()
  normalizes BOTH sides through the same extraction pipeline the creation
  path applies; createdVia still gates WHO is trusted (agent-authored seeds
  gain nothing). Regression tests: clause+role user seeds dispatch verbatim;
  reviewer-created goals with matching-cleaned seeds never get the trust.

### Mechanical pre-audit: maxBuffer ceiling killed verbose green suites (2026-08-23)

#### Fix
  runMechanicalPreAuditChecks passed no maxBuffer to execFileSync, so
  Node's default 1 MB cap applied: any contract gate whose output exceeds
  1 MB gets its child SIGTERMed by Node and the call throws ENOBUFS —
  which the banner logic (signal==="SIGTERM") then misreported as "killed
  after 600s". Field incident (2026-08-23, five consecutive auditor
  rounds on hellhunter's `bun test src/lib/game`): the gate emits ~1.17 MB
  of ALL-PASSING output and was unpassable by construction — every attempt
  died at ~1 MB (~15s in) while the identical tree passed green from an
  interactive shell 19/19 times, including piped-output and single-core
  pinned runs. Now passes maxBuffer: 64 MB, and ENOBUFS deaths no longer
  print the misleading 600s timeout banner.

## 0.35.34 — lastOutcome actually durable (2026-08-23)

### Fix
  Audit-pass finding: v0.35.30's "durable" last-outcome record was never
  serialized — persistStateLine omitted the field and readState never
  restored it, so any restart/reload blanked the widget retention line
  within its 24h window (the exact failure v0.35.30 fixed). Now always
  written (null when absent — readState spreads successive state events, so
  an omitted key would resurrect stale values and /glla wipe could never
  clear the record) and restored through a strict shape sanitizer (corrupt
  lines degrade to absent, never throw). Round-trip + corruption regression
  tests added.

## 0.35.33 — plan mode: the extended draft (2026-08-22)

### Add
  /goal plan | /list plan | /loop plan — the EXTENDED DRAFT for
  greenfield/megaplan work where the standard 5–7-question interview is too
  shallow (user design 2026-08-22). Research BEFORE questions (Explore
  subagents, file reads), multi-round interviewing (architecture → scope →
  failure conditions → verification), and a structured expanded objective:
  current-state analysis, decisions with rationale, milestone breakdown,
  per-milestone verification contract. Deliberately NOT a separate artifact —
  the objective itself is the single truth (the respec lesson: a second
  document always goes stale). Trust machinery unchanged: propose_*_draft +
  the Confirm card still gate activation; regular drafts stay the fast path.
  New prompts prompts/goal-loop-plan.md + goal-loop-plan-loop.md; depth flag
  on the drafting session (runtime-global, reset by clearDraftingState);
  completions on all three commands; /list plan gated as a mutating verb on
  stale handles. respec stays untouched (kept by user decision).

## 0.35.32 — hermetic settings round-trip test (2026-08-22)

### Fix
  tests/auditor-extensions.test.ts depended on the developer machine having
  ~/.pi/agent extensions to discover: on a bare CI home the discovered list
  was empty, the handler fell back to the input prompt, and the TUI-picker
  branch under test never ran (publish workflow failure). The test now seeds
  a project-scope `.pi/extensions/hermetic-ext.js` so discovery is non-empty
  on every machine; verified green under both an empty HOME and a populated one.

## 0.35.31 — user-seed trust for /goal start; loop plateau no longer false-stops on a never-moved baseline (2026-08-22)

### Fix 1: explicit /goal start paused by the suspicious-objective heuristic
  Field: Screenshot_20260822_193744 — `/goal start "…because we are logged in"`
  was parked as "Suspicious objective detected (dangling-fragment)" with a
  repair task queued instead of dispatching. The fragment heuristics exist
  for AGENT-authored report garbage; an explicit `/goal start` whose
  objective is verbatim a user seed now dispatches and ledgers
  `faulty_objective_user_seed_trusted` (/goal tweak remains available).
### Fix 2: loop plateau vs a degenerate zero baseline
  Field: doomtap loop stopped "plateau — best: 0" while iterations visibly
  fixed real findings: a min-direction metric reading 0 before work starts
  pins best at 0, so every later productive reading scores flat and burns
  plateau slots. Flat readings now count toward plateau only once the metric
  has demonstrably moved (an improvement on record, or best ≠ first measured
  reading of the run); a metric that NEVER moves gets its own loud bounded
  stop ("metric never moved …") after 2× window, not a fake plateau.

## 0.35.30 — durable last-outcome retention: the final verdict stays visible (2026-08-22)

### Gap
  Field report with screenshots (email-api-compare, 2026-08-22): "goal gets
  closed before final audit, so auditor never approves." Forensics showed the
  lifecycle was CORRECT — every archived goal had an approving verdict — but
  closeArchivedSlot nulled the widget slot the moment the goal archived, so
  after the agent's turn ended the surface went completely blank and the only
  trace of the approval was one transient toast. Returning later, "Auditor
  verdict pending" was the last visible text: indistinguishable from closed-
  without-audit.
### Ship
  - State.lastOutcome {at, ok, title, recap}: written by closeArchivedSlot on
    every terminal slot close (approved AND aborted), overwritten per outcome.
  - Widget: while no goal/list/loop occupies the slot, one dim retention line
    renders for 24h — "✓ done · auditor … approved · <recap>" or "▪ ended ·
    <reason>" — then goes silent. A live goal always outranks it.
  - /glla wipe clears the record (clean slate means clean).
  - Tests: tests/last-outcome-retention.test.ts (5) — render shapes, expiry +
    garbage-timestamp safety, live-goal precedence, source pins for both
    write and wipe-clear sites.

## 0.35.29 — /glla agents: tracked-subagent panel, transcript tail, widget segment (2026-08-22, GitHub issue #15)

### Gap
  During long fan-outs the only child visibility was the widget's 3-slot
  recent-action ring. A child that "almost completed its final report, went
  back to check some more, then crashed" was invisible: no live status, no
  counters, and no post-mortem trail anyone could find (issue #15).
  Scope agreed with the user: panel + transcript tail + widget line; a live
  activity stream was explicitly rejected as too noisy.
### Ship
  - getSubagentAgentsSnapshot() (goal-heartbeat.ts): read-only view of the
    tracked-subagent probes with hung classification mirroring the watchdog
    scan WITHOUT its counter mutation; record-frozen vs event-only evidence
    named; degrades gracefully when the pi-subagents manager registry is
    absent (as on currently installed versions).
  - /glla agents: ranked table (hung > running > ended), per-child
    tools/output/silent clocks, liveness hint on hung rows, 20-row cap with
    an explicit trim notice. Read-only, stale-safe.
  - /glla agents --tail <id> [--lines N]: locates the child's session file
    in the cwd-munged session store by needle + newest mtime and prints the
    last N entries tolerantly ([role] text, raw fallback). LOUD when nothing
    matches — searched dir, transcript count, needles. Never resumes or
    attaches to a child session.
  - Widget segment: "● N agents · <busiest> silent Xm ⚠" appended to every
    card shape via buildWidgetLines; hidden at zero tracked children.
  - New pure module extensions/goal-agents-panel.ts; snapshot reaches
    goal-commands via CommandDeps injection (no heartbeat import cycle).

## 0.35.28 — due-wait backstop: lapsed wait pauses actually resume; "you were recovered" notice (2026-08-22, GitHub issue #16)

### Root cause (field: goal paused 30min past its scheduled auto-resume while the agent narrated "the system should have auto-resumed by now")
  Auto-resume for pauseKind "wait" relied SOLELY on in-memory timers. An
  exhaustive map of every wait-pause site found: agent-authored waits
  (pause_goal kind="wait") armed NO timer at all while their own copy
  promised automatic continuation; error-brake cooldown waits were not
  re-armed on session_start; single-slot provider-retry timers could be
  silently clobbered by a later schedule; and no code path anywhere compared
  wall time against pauseResumeAt outside display rendering.
### Fix
  The heartbeat owns the durable invariant now: every tick, a wait whose
  pauseResumeAt lapsed >90s is re-fired — main-model recovery waits route to
  a provider probe, everything else clears the park and dispatches one fresh
  continuation. supervisorPaused() still freezes it under /glla pause and
  the load hold, one attempt per (goalId:resumeAt) key prevents storms (the
  route re-parks with a fresh resumeAt on failure), and every fire is
  ledgered wait_pause_overdue_resume. A stale hold persisted by a previous
  process is released when a consenting reload arrives. Issue part 2:
  resumed goals carry an autoResumed stamp rendered as a RECOVERY NOTICE in
  the continuation prompt — "welcome back, YOU were recovered" — so agents
  stop waiting for an external recovery signal that already happened.

## 0.35.27 — Windows auditor launch: quote only when needed, gate always first (2026-08-22, PR #17)

### Field report (PR #17, reproduced on Windows 11 + pnpm global shim)
  The detached auditor died ~0.5s after launch and retried forever: quoting
  EVERY argument wraps a bare executable name in quotes, which changes how
  cmd.exe resolves it and how npm/pnpm .CMD shims compute their own
  directory -> MODULE_NOT_FOUND -> "pi exited without an agent_settled RPC
  event" in a 60s retry loop of flashing terminal windows.
### Fix
  buildAuditorPiSpawnSpec now runs the WINDOWS_UNSAFE_ARG rejection on EVERY
  argument BEFORE the quoting decision, then quotes only when tokenization
  requires it (whitespace / cmd metacharacters / empty). Clean bare tokens
  reach cmd.exe untouched (shims resolve; full RPC sessions work); the
  upstream PR's variant was not mergeable as-is because its needs-quoting
  regex also gated the unsafe-arg check, letting %/CR/LF through bare.
  Regression tests pin all three classes through the spec builder.

## 0.35.26 — zombie watchdog recognizes pi-subagents tool names (2026-08-22, GitHub issue #13)

### Gap
  The v0.35.4 subagent-wait carve-out matched only the legacy built-in names
  (Agent / get_subagent_result / steer_subagent). The pi-subagents extension
  registers its foreground dispatch tool as "subagent" and a blocking wait as
  "subagent_wait", so a parent legitimately BUSY on a healthy foreground child
  tripped the bounded abort: field report shows a child writing Postgres
  records productively for 30 minutes while the parent was stream-silent on
  `subagent` — zombie_run_suspected at 20m, loop_stopped + zombie_run_aborted
  at 30m, productive work killed mid-write.
### Fix
  One shared SUBAGENT_WAIT_TOOL_NAMES set + isSubagentWaitCall predicate in
  goal-heartbeat.ts, consumed by BOTH sites (zombie stand-down and wedge-alert
  hint) so the lists cannot drift apart again. New names: "subagent",
  "subagent_wait". Behavioral tests drive the real heartbeat tick with a real
  tool_call event: stand-down while in flight, clean abort once it settles,
  no blanket amnesty.

## 0.35.25 — /loop resume honors the zero-stream abort park (2026-08-22, GitHub issue #14)

### Gap
  abortZombieRun parks a loop with stopReason "stopped: automatic zero-stream
  abort — ... (iteration N preserved; /loop resume to retry)" and its message
  promises /loop resume — but the RESUMABLE_STOP predicate in the resume
  handler never matched that prefix. The explicit resume answered "No held
  loop to resume"; iteration count, best value, and preserved history were
  unreachable without re-drafting from scratch (field report: a metricless
  24h loop parked at iteration 210 with 200 history entries).
### Fix
  RESUMABLE_STOP gains the "stopped: automatic zero-stream abort" prefix.
  The explicit resume now re-arms the loop exactly as promised: fresh stall
  window, re-armed counters, load hold released, one new dispatch — with
  iteration/best/history intact. Control test pins that non-resumable stops
  (e.g. bounds) stay stopped.

## 0.35.24 — auditor model picker at full selector parity: forbidden-models filtering (2026-08-22, note.md Next #1)

### Gap
  The /glla -> Auditor model row already hosted the /model-style fuzzy
  picker and persisted to the exact key resolveAuditorModel reads — but
  unlike every main-agent flow it did NOT apply forbidden-models policy:
  blocked models appeared in the list and the typed escape hatch accepted
  them, yielding pins the resolver silently skips at audit time.
### Fix
  promptModelRef gains an excludeRefs opt threading into buildModelPickItems
  (list-level filter) AND validating typed entries against isForbiddenModel
  (a policy match is refused with a warning naming the ref — never saved).
  Both auditor slots use it: Auditor model and Auditor fallback agent.
  A pin saved by the picker is one the resolver honors; runtime skips
  (auditor_model_fallback reason:"forbidden") remain as belt-and-suspenders.

## 0.35.23 — load without autostart: cold sessions hold automation for an explicit decision (2026-08-22, note.md Next #2)

### Root cause
  shouldAutoResumeOnSessionStart already demanded explicit `autoResume ===
  true` (v0.28.21 tri-state, undefined default = HOLD) — but its only
  consumer fed it the AGGRESSIVE-MODE COERCED value (unset -> true because
  aggressiveMode defaults on), so stock installs auto-resumed everything on
  every session load despite the documented default. Three further paths
  bypassed the consent entirely.
### Fixes
  - Load consent now reads the RAW global autoResume setting; aggressive
    mode keeps owning its caps only. Default (unset/false) = restore and
    DISPLAY state, hold automation.
  - New durable loadHoldAt state engages through the SAME freeze gates as
    /glla pause (continuation dispatch, loop ticks, heartbeat refires,
    recovery timers); released by any explicit work command (/goal resume,
    /list resume, /list next, /loop resume|start, new goal creation),
    each release ledgered load_hold_released. Heartbeat host-loss
    supervision stays armed under the hold — a held plane is never an
    unprobed idle plane.
  - Closed consent bypasses: different-pid crash successors no longer
    auto-resume held loops or replay journals as automation (same-process
    /reload successors keep continuity); parked completion-audit claims no
    longer auto-retry on a bare cold start (the main-model-recovery one-
    shot retry keeps its pinned consent).

## 0.35.22 — a queued item blocked by a live loop is loud and self-heals at loop end (2026-08-22)

### suspicious-unstartable-repair-card fix (note.md Next #3)
  Field (screenshots 20260821_114109/114210/134442/134645): /goal start of a
  lowercase-fragment objective paused the goal and queued a repair task; the
  card said "/list next starts the preserved repair/replan task" — but with
  the Chrome-Bridge loop owning the surface, activateNextListItem's
  one-active-thing guard refused activation LEDGER-ONLY: unstartable AND
  invisibly blocked. Two fixes:
  - the refusal now notifies with the queued objective and the way out
    ("/loop stop … then /list next"), and the ledger names what stayed queued;
  - when a loop ends by ANY route (/loop stop, /loop finish, plateau/bounds
    stop), resumeQueuedListAfterLoopEnd retries list activation when no goal
    owns the surface — the blocked entry starts instead of staying dead.
  Also: tests/list-invisible-restart.test.ts no longer depends on co-resident
  module state (unique owner session + explicit reset), fixing the cross-file
  ordering failure surfaced by audit round eight.

## 0.35.21 — list queue stays visible across lifecycle boundaries (2026-08-22)

### list-invisible-until-restart fix (note.md Next #4)
  Field: a stopped/interrupted /list exec left the queue surface blank —
  active item only, no "N waiting · up next" line — until a session
  restart. Root cause: the sidebar renders state.list from MEMORY while the
  durable queue is the UNION of the state ledger and the per-item
  .queue.json sidecars (v0.34.60 disk-first writes); a plugin re-init /
  stale-handle window reset RAM to defaults and only some later path
  re-ran the disk merge. session_start's restore now converges memory to
  that union immediately (hydrateListQueueFromDisk after readState), so
  the next lifecycle boundary heals the surface without a restart; the
  hydration notifies with a truthful count ("restored N queued list
  item(s)"). Regression tests: sidecar-only item is hydrated AND rendered;
  convergence is idempotent (no duplicate for items in both stores).

## 0.35.20 — one bounded automatic retry for transient mechanical-check deaths (2026-08-21)

### Gate resilience
  Field (sixth audit round): the pre-audit gate died MID-RUN under machine
  load ~30 — output ends inside a passing file, no runner summary, exit 1 —
  while the identical tree passed green twice in isolation. Resource
  contention, not a red suite. Mechanical check commands now get exactly ONE
  bounded automatic retry on failure: a deterministic red command stays red
  on both attempts (final output names the retry and preserves the second
  attempt's diagnostics); a first-attempt transient death followed by a
  passing retry passes with an honest `recoveredRetryNote` in the result.
  Mirrors the v0.35.17 zero-stream auto-retry philosophy at the gate level.

## 0.35.19 — load-resilient budgets for the aggressive-recovery test (2026-08-21)

### Flake hardening
  At machine load ~50 (16 cores), the aggressive no-verdict recovery test's
  wall-clock wait budgets (2x 25s inside a 60s per-test ceiling) expired
  before two real subprocess-based auditor retry cycles completed — while
  the canonical full-suite run stayed green in the same conditions. Raised:
  per-test 60s→120s, retry waits 25s→45s, state-transition waits 8s→20s.
  Budgets only; semantics untouched (same precedent as v0.35.15's 30s→60s).

## 0.35.18 — mechanical checks resolve raw runners to their canonical scripts (2026-08-21)

### Spurious fast-fail fix (fourth audit round)
  A verification contract that names a RAW RUNNER in prose ("passes under
  `bun test`") made the deterministic pre-audit execute `bun test` bare,
  ignoring the project's own required configuration encoded in package.json
  scripts (--parallel=1 --max-concurrency=1 --timeout; this suite shares
  module state process-wide by design and serializes deliberately). The bare
  invocation failed 6 tests + 5 nested-test errors while the canonical gate
  was green twice — a spurious fast-fail of finished work. Mechanical check
  commands that are exactly a raw runner invocation (bun test / vitest /
  jest, no extra args) now resolve to the package script that wraps them;
  narrower runs and non-runner programs pass through untouched. Pure resolver
  (`resolveCanonicalRunnerCommand`) lives in goal-loop-backoff.ts with unit
  tests; bunfig cannot express the required flags (verified empirically:
  `[test] timeout` is not honored on bun 1.3.14).

## 0.35.17 — zero-stream abort gains ONE bounded automatic retry; tag backfill (2026-08-21)

### Post-accept hang self-heal (note.md Next §1)
  Turns dispatched by accepting a Confirm dialog hung with zero provider
  stream activity often enough that users repeatedly returned to parked
  "action needed" sessions (field screenshot 20260821_152311). The watchdog's
  bounded abort was correct; what was missing is self-heal. The FIRST silence
  of a zero-stream streak now arms exactly ONE automatic retry ~90s after the
  park — the parked goal/list item/loop auto-resumes through the durable
  continuation machinery and one fresh dispatch goes out. A SECOND consecutive
  silence refuses further retries (`zombie_auto_retry_refused_streak`) and
  parks permanently for manual resume; real stream activity between aborts
  resets the streak so an independent later hang earns its own single retry.
  `/glla pause` freezes the retry like every other automatic side-effect;
  the timer only clears a pause carrying exactly the watchdog's own reason
  (a newer manual/recovery pause supersedes it); the heartbeat's one-shot
  abort latch is released on retry dispatch so a fully-silent retry can still
  be re-aborted. Pure streak decision lives in goal-loop-backoff.ts
  (`zombieRetryDecision`) with unit tests; behavioral coverage drives the
  full hang→abort/park→auto-resume→re-dispatch arc plus the double-hang and
  pause-during-waystation paths (tests/post-accept-hang-retry.test.ts).

### Version tags backfilled
  All 41 released versions missing their `v<version>` git tag (v0.34.20 …
  v0.35.16) were tagged at the historical commit whose package.json carried
  that exact version and pushed to all remotes. Additive-only — no history
  rewrite.

### README currency pass
  Documents the v0.35.15 per-phase glyphs/activity meter/silent-stretch
  footer, `/glla pause`, and the v0.35.17 zero-stream auto-retry.

## 0.35.16 — mechanical pre-audit gate no longer kills legitimate long checks (2026-08-21)

### Deterministic pre-audit timeout fix
  `runMechanicalPreAuditChecks` executed every contract command under a
  hard 60-second `execFileSync` ceiling — but this repo's own contract
  command (`npm run release:check`) legitimately needs ~3 minutes. Every
  deterministic pre-audit therefore fast-failed with a truncated
  head-of-output report showing only startup logs (two field rounds:
  2026-08-21 14:17 and 16:01), burning two auditor cycles on a gate that
  could never pass inside its own bound. The default bound is now 10 minutes
  — still a hang guard, no longer an honest-slow-work guard. Failed output
  keeps the TAIL (where failures live) instead of the head, truncation is
  labeled, and a timeout kill is bannered as such instead of masquerading as
  an exit-code-1 test failure.

## 0.35.15 — glla status-surface UX: visual footer, /glla pause, proactive quiet notify (2026-08-21)

### Visual status footer
  The auditing footer now leads each auditor phase with a distinct glyph
  (queued ⋯ · running ▶ · quiet ◌ · blocked ⛔ · awaiting-verdict ✓) and a
  compact draining activity meter (▰▱) that empties as worker silence grows
  toward the quiet threshold. A glance answers "is the audit alive?" without
  reading the sentence.

### /glla pause | resume — broad supervisor freeze
  `/glla pause` freezes ALL automatic machinery — heartbeat re-arms, stale
  probes, zombie cleanup, main-model recovery probes, automatic completion-
  audit recovery, continuation dispatch, loop ticks, and the proactive quiet
  notification — while leaving the active goal/list item/loop and any
  detached worker untouched. The flag persists via `supervisorPausedAt`, so a
  session restart cannot silently re-arm machinery the user explicitly
  stopped. `/glla resume` clears it first, then resumes whatever else is
  resumable, and never follows with a misleading "Nothing to resume". Manual
  user commands always still work.

### Proactive auditor quiet reporting
  Entering the quiet phase (~3 min of zero worker activity) now fires exactly
  ONE warning notify instead of only recoloring the status chip — the field
  complaint was an 8-minute silent stretch the user only discovered after the
  fact. Once activity resumes, the footer shows "silent Xm then resumed" for
  10 minutes so a missed silence stays visible.

### Persistence fix (latent bug)
  `persistStateLine` never serialized `lastCompactionAt` despite v0.34.97's
  comment claiming it did — the ⏳ compacting… chip silently lost its reload
  survival. Both epoch fields now ride the state line with explicit nulls so
  ledger merges clear them correctly.

## 0.35.14 — full extension audit hardening (2026-08-21)

### Verification and lifecycle integrity
  Mechanical contract checks now run through a shell-free literal-argument
  boundary, auditor verdicts require one final terminal marker, and regression
  shield references must appear inside `<evidence>`. Invalid persisted IDs are
  rejected at state hydration and filesystem boundaries. Child extension
  factories no longer claim the host API or start timers before an admitted
  `session_start`; completion approval cannot report success when terminal
  archiving fails, and branch-mode loop resumes refuse the wrong branch.

### Release contract
  Published documentation includes the linked planning files, the workflow
  runs the release contract on pushes and pull requests, and release tooling
  uses pinned Node/npm versions.

## 0.35.13 — stale-API recovery loop fix (2026-08-20)

### Stale-handle recovery correctness
  Heartbeat recovery now validates the captured `ExtensionAPI` separately
  from `ExtensionContext`. A context that still answers `isIdle()` cannot
  revive an API that Pi has invalidated, so glla keeps the durable interruption
  parked instead of repeatedly announcing recovery and retrying the same dead
  continuation handle.

## 0.35.12 — npm 12 pack-report compatibility (2026-08-20)

### Keyed npm 12 dry-run reports
  The release contract now handles npm 12's keyed JSON dry-run shape in
  addition to the array and single-object shapes used by earlier npm
  versions, while retaining path normalization for package contents.

## 0.35.11 — npm pack report shape compatibility (2026-08-20)

### Single-object and array npm reports
  The release contract accepts both JSON shapes emitted by npm's dry-run
  command: a single report object and an array of report objects. It continues
  to normalize root-relative and `package/`-prefixed file paths before checking
  the published documentation set.

## 0.35.10 — npm pack report compatibility (2026-08-20)

### Multi-entry npm dry-run reports
  The release contract aggregates all entries returned by npm's JSON dry-run
  report before checking the published documentation set. This supports npm
  versions that return multiple package report entries in trusted publishing.

## 0.35.9 — release packaging compatibility (2026-08-20)

### Cross-version npm tarball contract
  The release contract normalizes npm's root-relative and `package/`-prefixed
  dry-run file paths, keeping documentation coverage checks stable across the
  npm versions used by local development and trusted publishing.

## 0.35.8 — main-model preferred-primary failback (2026-08-20)

### Main-model preferred-primary failback
  Main-agent fallback recovery now defaults to `mainModelFailback=auto`: a
  successful fallback turn keeps the original primary durable and schedules a
  supervised health probe using `mainModelPrimaryProbeMinutes` (15 minutes by
  default). A healthy primary is selected automatically; `sticky` preserves
  the legacy stay-on-fallback behavior. Probe intent and pending switches
  survive reloads, and the policy is exposed in the Main agent settings tab.

## 0.35.7 — fast-fail pre-audits, zero-pause execution, and milestone gating (2026-08-20)

### Deterministic fast-fail mechanical pre-audits
  `extractMechanicalCheckCommands` and `runMechanicalPreAuditChecks` in
  `extensions/goal-loop-shield.ts` parse explicit shell command gates
  (`npm test`, `bun test`, `tsc --noEmit`, `cargo test`, etc.) from the
  verification contract. On `complete_goal`, the orchestrator runs mechanical
  checks deterministically first. If any command fails, it synthesizes an
  instant fast-fail disapproval in ~200ms with verbatim terminal output inside
  `<evidence>`, returning immediate actionable feedback to the agent without
  wasting tokens or 45 seconds on an LLM audit pass.

### Two-phase decision architecture & non-interruption law
  `LONG_RUNNING_JUDGMENT_POLICY` and the execution prompts enforce deep
  upfront grilling during drafting followed by 100% unattended autonomous
  execution. The agent is strictly forbidden from pausing for obvious choices,
  cosmetic naming, or non-blocking secondary questions: it picks the sensible
  architectural default, implements the root-cause fix, records its rationale,
  and continues. Non-blocking notes are deferred to the final completion
  summary.

### Stale-handle watchdog self-healing
  In `extensions/goal-heartbeat.ts`, when the 15-second heartbeat detects that
  the initial factory `ExtensionAPI` handle threw a stale-API error after an
  internal Pi session replacement, it attempts `tryAbsorbHostSuccessor` with
  the live file-backed context before declaring terminal stale loss, eliminating
  false-positive `host session lost` stalls.

### Structured task milestone gating
  `Task` and `TaskProposal` schemas now support per-task `verificationContract`
  milestone gates. In `complete_task`, if a task defines a verification gate,
  its mechanical checks are executed deterministically before the task can be
  marked complete, preventing early errors from compounding over multi-hour runs.

## 0.35.6 — long-term preferences policy boundary (2026-08-19)

### Typed-boundary regression pins
  Implements the durable pin set called out in the long-term preferences
  policy contract (audit/LONG-TERM-PREFERENCES-POLICY-2026-08-19.md):

  - The continuation prompt template carries no auto-injected preference
    or remembered section.
  - No extension auto-prefers a remembered prose value
    (function-name walk + XML-block walk over extensions/).
  - The `Settings` interface has no opaque free-form text field
    described as memory / preference / remember.
  - `saveSettings` is the only writer to the settings JSON files; both
    `globalSettingsPath()` and `projectSettingsPath()` route through
    `os.homedir()` / `cwd` (env override accepted), and every other
    extension is checked for direct `writeFile*` calls against the
    settings basenames.
  - `extensions/goal-settings.ts` cites the policy artifact in its
    header so the safety contract is reachable from the typed boundary.

  The pin set is structural and negative: it fails closed if a future
  refactor adds any "auto-preference from prose" pathway, an untyped
  setting key, or a non-settings writer to the typed storage API.

## 0.35.5 — six-label completionSummary shape (2026-08-19)

### Tool schema adopts the six-label recap
  `complete_goal`'s schema description now recommends the Outcome / Changed /
  Evidence / Tests / Unresolved / Next shape from
  `audit/COMPLETION-SUMMARY-POLICY-2026-08-19.md` and points callers at the
  policy doc. Free-form prose is still allowed but discouraged. The detached
  auditor continues to receive `completionSummary` and `verificationSummary`
  as independent fields; the policy-review decision (typed object vs labeled
  string) is preserved.

### Regressions
  `tests/completion-recap-shape.test.ts` adds two pins:
  - the detached auditor's prompt renders the two claims as separate
    `<completion_summary>` / `<verification_summary>` blocks (the executor
    claim is not the auditor's verdict);
  - the `complete_goal` tool schema names every label and references the
    policy artifact (so a future refactor cannot rewrite the description
    back to "1-paragraph completion claim" without breaking this test).

## 0.35.4 — auditor reports in continuation prompts and repair-loop closure (2026-08-16)

### Continuation prompts carry the latest auditor verdict
  After a disapproval the continuation now includes the full auditor report
  verbatim (LATEST AUDITOR DISAPPROVAL / IMPOSSIBLE / REGRESSION SHIELD
  BLOCKED sections), so the agent sees the actual objections instead of
  digging them out of the audit journal by hand. A STALE AUDITOR APPROVAL
  directive mirrors the `complete_goal` revision gate exactly: it fires only
  on a numeric revision mismatch (legacy audit entries without a revision
  field pass the gate unchanged and are never called stale), and its advice
  matches the gate's real escapes — `/goal verify` first, or a claim carrying
  `newObjective` — never a bare retry, which the gate rejects.

### Replan confirmation consumes the source queue fragment
  Confirming a replan card for a faulty queued fragment now removes that
  source item from the durable queue and its sidecar (matched by the repair
  target id and an unchanged fragment objective; user edits to the item win).
  This breaks the repair-respawn loop where a fixed fragment reactivated a
  third repair card after the repair goal archived.

### DECIDE findings default to a decision
  DECIDE findings are raised to the user once and resolved as decided unless
  genuinely blocked; the policy-flip keeps the loop moving instead of
  re-asking the same question.

### Settings honesty and audit-loop cleanups
  The settings menu shows the EFFECTIVE aggressive defaults for unset rows
  (unset no longer reads as off); the auditor prompt no longer claims an
  auto-continue the detached auditor does not perform; recovery surfaces
  bound non-sensitive provider errors; the smoke test matches verdict-time
  surfaces instead of prose; the schema documents revision, pendingTasks and
  completionSummary; dead reviewer knobs are gone; examples and install docs
  no longer state stale claims.

## 0.35.3 — live auditor clock and clearer recovery timing (2026-08-15)

### Detached auditor status keeps moving between worker events
  The UI ticker now refreshes auditing states, and the auditor elapsed clock
  advances from its attempt start between progress-file updates. Long bash or
  thinking intervals no longer look frozen; stale workers still become quiet
  and hit the existing watchdogs.

### Total time and recovery activity are labeled honestly
  Goal cards and the active status HUD now label wall-clock lifetime as
  `total`, while recovery surfaces say `last host activity` so retry/error
  events are not confused with useful goal progress.

## 0.35.2 — role-specific agent settings and compact values (2026-08-15)

### Agent settings are separated by role
  Main agent, Drafter, Auditor, and Subagents now have separate settings tabs.
  Each role keeps its model, thinking, and fallback controls together; the
  current main agent is shown as a runtime value rather than being confused
  with its fallback chain.

### Model values remain visible
  The settings table defaults to a compact view that gives the VALUE column the
  available width. Press `d` to toggle the long descriptions. Drafter and
  auditor fallback values show the effective/requested thinking level when the
  model registry exposes the capability map.

## 0.35.1 — drafter agent controls and settings taxonomy (2026-08-15)

### Drafter thinking follows the selected agent
  The drafter picker now offers the thinking levels supported by the selected
  model, persists an explicit `drafterThinkingLevel`, reapplies it across the
  drafter fallback chain, and restores the user's original session thinking
  level after the temporary drafting lease ends.

### Settings name agents and fallbacks honestly
  The former **Backups** tab is now **Agents**. Main, drafter, and subagent
  entries are presented as agents with optional fallback agents/models; the
  persisted setting keys and operational fallback commands remain compatible.

## 0.35.0 — explicit designer routing and drafting recovery (2026-08-15)

### Long-running judgment is a prompt contract
  Drafting and continuation now preserve the objective and verification
  contract, prefer durable root-cause fixes, permit safe reversible workarounds
  when useful, and reserve questions for genuine decision boundaries. The
  unattended fallback is explicit and never guesses a provider reset.

### Designer is a real managed role
  `Agent: Designer`, `Role: designer`, and `Designer: yes` route an explicit
  goal, list item, or task-plan checkpoint to a managed read-only Designer
  subagent. The role persists through queue/goal/task state, appears in status
  and markdown, has editable model/fallback settings, and falls back inline
  when the role or provider is unavailable.

### Drafting has its own temporary model chain
  `/goal`, `/list`, and `/loop` drafting can use a dedicated primary plus
  ordered fallbacks. Provider failures retry the existing interview on the
  next eligible drafter candidate, including one bounded same-session retry as
  the last resort. The lease is generation-fenced, restored after confirmation
  or interruption, and never consumes the main-model or auditor chains.

### Host and continuation audit
  The Pi session-replacement limitation is documented with a concrete
  event-safe API request and acceptance tests. Codex, Claude Code, and DeepSeek
  Harness continuation approaches were compared; the result is a durable
  checkpoint/resume design decision, not a provider-specific retry change.

## 0.34.142 — fully reason-agnostic provider recovery (2026-08-15)

### No quota policy or availability inference
  Main-model and detached-auditor recovery no longer classify provider text,
  status codes, billing/rate-limit wording, or `Retry-After` hints to choose a
  fallback or delay. All recoverable provider failures use the same eager
  retry, bounded ladder, and optional blind `hourlyRetryProbe` at `:00:30`
  after each hour starts. Legacy quota-named state is normalized as inert
  compatibility metadata only.

### Current recovery surface is generic
  User-facing cards, notifications, and pause actions use generic provider
  recovery copy. Diagnostics remain bounded and sanitized for the ledger and
  audit history. Obsolete `mainModelFallbackOnRateLimit`, `hourlyQuotaProbe`,
  and `quotaRetryMinutes` settings are migrated away and cannot change the
  effective policy.

## 0.34.141 — aggressive default and quota-agnostic hourly recovery (2026-08-15)
### Aggressive mode is now the default
  `aggressiveMode` resolves to ON when unset, enabling keep-going defaults for
  auto-resume, audit/stall limits, wedge alerts, and infrastructure recovery.
  Set it explicitly to `false` for the conservative pause-first policy;
  explicit per-key settings still win.

### Recovery retries without quota checks
  Detached-auditor infrastructure failures no longer suppress the eager retry
  based on account, billing, rate-limit, or upstream Retry-After wording. The
  shared plan retries once after 5 seconds, then schedules stored-claim probes
  at `:00:30` after every local hour starts. Provider classifications remain
  sanitized diagnostics only; the existing durable 5-attempt/24-hour safety
  envelope remains in place.

## 0.34.140 — resilient completion auditing and zombie recovery (2026-08-15)
### No-verdict completion audits keep a safe recovery path
  Completion-auditor timeouts and infrastructure failures remain explicitly
  non-verdict outcomes. Normal mode keeps one durable retry; `aggressiveMode`
  re-arms the isolated auditor inside a durable 24-hour recovery window,
  persisting the retry count and horizon across lifecycle changes.

### Zombie cleanup remains retryable after a rejected claim
  The zero-stream watchdog records its abort latch only after the activation
  guard accepts and completes cleanup, so a transient stale-generation or
  session guard rejection can be retried by a later heartbeat. Regression tests
  cover both the durable auditor retry and the cleanup ordering.

## 0.34.139 — bounded main-model fallbacks and process cleanup (2026-08-15)
### Main sessions keep an ordered fallback chain
  Main-model backup settings are normalized case-insensitively, capped at ten
  alternatives, and the ordered chain leads the Backups tab with a visible
  count. The multi-select picker shows `current → backup 1 → backup 2`, numbers
  each selected row, supports Space add/remove, and Tab enters an explicit
  order mode where ↑/↓ moves a chain row (brackets also reorder while
  browsing); provider failures walk the
  durable ordered cursor one supervised model at a time. Main recovery base
  minutes are effective, the optional :00:30 hourly probe is armed for every
  parked recovery and can be toggled live, and the recovery settings are
  global-only. Explicit HTTP 429/rate-limit diagnostics remain retryable
  request-rate failures rather than token-limit labels; they stay on the
  current model while account/plan/billing/auth failures may walk the backup chain.
  Restore selections no longer cancel recovery, user aborts do not masquerade
  as successful turns, and malformed saved recovery state is sanitized before
  timers or model switches use it.

### Detached workers are reaped as process trees
  Parent cancellation and watchdog paths now wait for worker exit and escalate
  when a detached worker ignores SIGTERM. Worker-owned lock metadata lets a
  replacement host reap stale workers from a previous pi process. The smoke
  harness and direct worker tests now clean up their tmux/process trees on
  interruption or assertion failure.

### Release-test isolation is order-independent
  bun test runs every file through the same worker process under
  `--max-concurrency=1`, so the pid-scoped test settings file was shared
  across all files: a test writing `autoResume:true` poisoned later files
  whenever discovery order differed (CI surfaced this as
  hegemon-queue-unblock-evidence auto-activating a repair goal). The preload
  now resets the shared settings file before each file, and the blocked-
  activation regression pins its no-autoResume precondition explicitly.

## 0.34.138 — CI-safe auditor timing and release validation (2026-08-13)
### CI auditor timing has headroom
  Process-backed auditor regressions use a CI-safe wall-clock allowance, and
  lifecycle polling tolerates slower hosted runners without changing production
  watchdog behavior.

### Restore-gate release test is hermetic
  The first default-settings restore-gate regression explicitly disables global
  auto-resume before seeding its fixture, preventing a reused CI preload settings
  file from changing the expected held-on-start result.

## 0.34.136 — isolated release validation and stable queue ordering (2026-08-13)
### Release validation isolates test files and normalizes queue order
  Release tests now run each file in an isolated global context, while disk queue
  readers sort sidecar names before parsing. This removes shared-runtime state
  leakage and filesystem-dependent ordering from CI and package validation.

## 0.34.135 — deterministic release validation (2026-08-13)
### Release checks are deterministic under CI
  The package test scripts now run Bun tests with bounded serial concurrency and
  an explicit per-test timeout, preventing shared temporary-fixture races in
  the release workflow.

## 0.34.134 — Windows detached auditor launch and package release (2026-08-13)
### Windows detached auditor launch and atomic protocol retries
  Windows npm installations expose `pi.cmd` rather than a directly executable
  `pi` binary. The detached auditor now uses an explicit, quoted `cmd.exe`
  shim boundary without Node's unsafe shell-argument concatenation. Worker and
  parent atomic JSON writes retry transient Windows rename locks while keeping
  the previous snapshot visible. This addresses GitHub issue #7 and supersedes
  the equivalent launch portions of PRs #8 and #9. Regression coverage pins the
  launch and retry contracts.

### License switched to AGPL-3.0-only
  The package metadata, lockfile, README, and bundled `LICENSE` now identify the
  project as GNU Affero General Public License v3.0-only.

### `/glla version` identifies the installed package
  The new read-only `/glla version` action reads the adjacent package manifest,
  reports the version loaded by the running extension, and includes the
  registry comparison command so stale installations are visible without
  mutating live goal state. Completion and documentation cover the command.

### Provider-wall recovery copy is sanitized and episode-deduplicated
  Quota, provider-wall, and detached-auditor diagnostics now have separate
  durable and user-facing projections. Chat/tool/recovery copy uses stable
  classifications instead of raw Token Plan/429 payloads, while bounded raw
  diagnostics remain in ledger, active, and archive state for forensics.
  Recovery episodes persist a notice key so repeated retries do not replay the
  same warning. Regressions cover raw-payload redaction, diagnostic retention,
  changing retry hints/request ids, and one-notice-per-episode behavior.

### Hourly provider-wall probe survives failed recovery probes
  The optional `:00:30` recovery ticker now re-arms after its asynchronous
  probe settles, even when the failed probe clears the normal recovery timer.
  Generation and fresh-host checks prevent stale sessions from creating a
  timer, and manual recovery holds remain quiet. Regression coverage pins the
  failure-safe re-arm path.

### Valid imperative recovery objectives keep their saved intent
  Faulty-objective recovery no longer treats every imperative mentioning
  auditor or verification machinery as reviewer metadata. Explicit reviewer
  markers and non-actionable fragments remain fenced, while saved list work
  such as the detached-auditor recovery item can activate normally.

### Parked completion audits get one durable healthy-recovery retry
  A `recovery-pending` detached-auditor claim now records and consumes one
  automatic retry only after a validated lifecycle/recovery event. The retry
  is generation/context fenced and repeated lifecycle events cannot create a
  storm; a failed retry preserves the claim for explicit `/goal resume`, and
  cold startup still holds it. Behavioral coverage exercises the persisted
  one-shot marker, repeated events, and manual recovery.

### Host-loss and no-verdict auditor recovery no longer parks indefinitely
  A stale terminal now keeps only a generation-fenced heartbeat/UI probe alive,
  allowing a same-process handle to self-heal without requiring a reload while
  all sends remain stopped. A validated file-backed successor also consumes the
  existing one-shot detached-auditor recovery for parked claims instead of
  requiring manual resume. Auditor timeout/infrastructure no-verdict claims now
  persist a one-minute recovery due time, retry the stored claim exactly once,
  and then remain available for explicit resume if that retry fails. Cold/manual
  startup still holds the claim honestly, and status/widget copy distinguishes a
  scheduled retry from an indefinite parked claim. Auditor transport results now
  carry explicit provider/timeout/no-verdict classes, spawn failures surface
  immediately instead of wall-timing out, and stale-context apply paths fail
  closed without mutating through a retained handle.

### Power-mode auditor: bash restored with bounded tool execution
  The detached auditor intentionally restores `bash` alongside read/grep/find/ls
  so it can run bounded tests, inspect git state, and reproduce behavior. This
  is an explicit power-over-safety decision, not a read-only contract. The
  independent five-minute parent/worker tool timeout and `--no-approve` remain
  in place; unsupported tool events are still rejected. The prompt now exposes
  bash as an audit capability while telling the model not to mutate unless the
  objective requires it.

### Detached auditor hardening: no shell/trust privilege and bounded tools
  Completion auditors now run with only `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`; the
  worker uses `--no-approve` and rejects any unexpected tool event, closing the
  prompt-injection path that paired repository-controlled content with an
  approved shell. The auditor prompt treats inspected files as untrusted data
  and no longer requests bash. A separate five-minute per-read-tool timeout is
  enforced by both the detached parent and worker, independent of heartbeat
  freshness and the inactivity brake, so a tool that emits no end event cannot
  consume the full 30-minute audit wall. Regression tests cover the exact RPC
  argv, disallowed bash events, parent and worker tool timeouts.

### Truthful list-audit fan-out dedupe and cap accounting
  The list-audit collector previously joined every queued objective into one
  string and searched for each finding's first 60 characters. A distinct
  finding whose prefix appeared inside another objective was silently dropped.
  Fan-out now matches each queue item against the canonical `Fix audit finding:
  <finding> — Done when:` prefix, so only the same finding is deduped. The
  50-item cap is also accounted separately: `alreadyQueued` counts true queue
  matches, while `deferredByCap` counts eligible findings held for a later
  `/list audit` run and is shown in the ledger and notification. Regression
  coverage exercises both the substring collision and 51-item cap cases.

### Already-shipped guard: version-less claims route to the normal audit
  Field evidence 2026-08-11 (dracon-platform): a session restart restored the
  OLD conversation; the continuation carried a NEW goal whose fix was genuinely
  already shipped, and the v0.34.96 guard aborted it correctly. But the
  version-less "already shipped" path is a pure phrase-trigger with zero
  corroboration — a hallucinated version-less claim (from the same stale-
  restore mechanism) would abort a finding that still needs work and silently
  drop it from the queue. Version-less claims ("already shipped", "no new
  work shipped", no vX.Y.Z anywhere in the summary) now route to the NORMAL
  completion audit with the label carried into the audited recap ("NOTE:
  version-less … claim — the auditor must verify the work exists in the tree"):
  a true claim is approved into a truthful complete; a false claim is
  disapproved and the finding stays queued. Version-bearing claims ("already
  shipped in vX.Y.Z", "verified vX.Y.Z covers this") keep the abort — the
  named version is the corroboration. Ledger event complete_goal_already_shipped
  now carries routedToAudit (true = normal audit, false = aborted).

### Standalone Auditor thinking row + headless /glla list sync
  The v0.31.4 comment claimed "/glla thinking= remains the direct path"
  for changing the auditor's thinking level — no such action ever
  existed, so the ONLY way to change it was re-picking the auditor model.
  Added a standalone Auditor thinking row (same ladder + dialog as the
  model flow; the v0.31.4 "no row to forget about" design was about the
  CONFUSING dialog, fixed in v0.31.7, not about the row itself). The
  headless /glla fallback list also missed decisionPopup, carryover,
  auditorModelFallback, auditorSameSessionSwap, auditorSilent,
  auditorProgressSignals, hourlyQuotaProbe, subagentModelStrategy,
  subagentModelOverrides, subagentFallbacks and toolOverrides — synced.

### /glla settings table completeness (hourlyQuotaProbe + toolOverrides rows, provenance fix)
  Settings-menu audit (2026-08-10): the hourly-quota-probe toggle had a
  dispatcher handler but NO row in the table — the setting the user asked
  to keep was only reachable by hand-editing the JSON. Added the row to
  Backups. The toolOverrides feature had only the /glla tooloverride CLI;
  the table now carries a Tool overrides row (Other) with an interactive
  project-scoped editor (list / allow / hide / unallow / unhide / set /
  unset). subagentFallbacks was missing from SETTINGS_KEYS so its rows
  always showed provenance "default" — key added; the wedge-alert doc
  comment claimed 45 but the real default is 30
  (WEDGE_ALERT_DEFAULT_MINUTES) — corrected.

### Quota-reset time claims removed from UI; temporary quota messages honored at their own short window
  (`note.md` 2026-08-10, Screenshot_20260810_224142/224136/224132/224119/224114).
  Field sessions parked on provider walls showed `next: quota reset at
  23:00` / `no turns until quota reset at 23:00` / `waiting for quota
  reset at HH:MM` on every surface (widget card, status bar, queued line,
  paused line). The user's correction: the provider window is NOT a
  guaranteed reset and the :00:30 hourly probe can pick work back up
  earlier — the time claim is wrong, and it must not appear in the UI at
  all. All four surfaces now say `parked on provider wall — retrying
  automatically` (no clock claim).
  Separately, a temporary quota message ("try again in 30 seconds",
  "please wait 1 minute", "rate limit resets in 15 seconds", "available
  again in 2 minutes", "temporarily over quota") previously fell through
  to the hour-aligned fallback — the goal "gave up and waited for a
  bigger reset" despite the provider stating a short window.
  parseQuotaError now recognizes these prose shapes as upstream
  Retry-After facts (honored up to the 5h probe cap), and explicitly
  temporary wording classifies as a retryable rate-limit (plain
  "temporarily unavailable" stays ambiguous). The hourly probe remains
  setting-only (hourlyQuotaProbe toggle) with no UI surface.

### Stale goal card actions + unexplained QUEUED status + false watchdog interrupt after recovery
  (`note.md` 2026-08-10, Screenshot_20260810_221249 + 221345). Three UI/UX
  findings from the field:
  - **Stale action on the goal card**: the `recentActions` ring was not
    goal-scoped — the previous goal's `✓ complete_goal` leaked onto the new
    goal's card. Tool results now stamp `at`, and the card only shows actions
    newer than the goal's creation (`>= createdAt − 5s`; unstamped legacy
    entries stay visible).
  - **QUEUED status with no explanation**: the queued line now reports
    `turn pending` (a continuation is dispatched but not yet acknowledged)
    plus host last-activity freshness, so a waiting card says WHY it waits.
  - **False "did not start turn" interrupt**: the continuation watchdog fired
    90s after a main-model-recovery resume while the model chain was still
    warming up (goal `20260810205826-npnmfa`, watchdog at 21:13:15Z, turn
    started 21:14:36Z). `mainModelRecoverySucceeded` now stamps
    `lastMainModelRecoveryResumeAt`; the watchdog re-arms within a 5-minute
    recovery grace (`continuation_start_paused_for_recovery`, capped at 10
    re-arms) instead of interrupting.
  Test-suite hardening found while verifying:
  - the new module-level recovery-resume stamp leaked across files in bun's
    shared-process node:test runner (blocked-pause-autoclear set it via
    `mainModelRecoverySucceeded`; its resetModuleState now clears it) — this
    re-armed 7 continuation-watchdog tests in sibling files;
  - auditor-process fragment test: 25ms emit gaps let a stretched parent poll
    miss intermediate byte counts (sampling race) — gaps widened to 120ms,
    wall timeout 2s→5s;
  - behavioral watchdog tests: real-time wait budgets widened (1.5s→4s) so
    heavy-CI load does not stretch 300ms test timers past the deadline.

### Widget spacer renders as a stray dot in π-web; agents-panel separator padding
  (`note.md` 2026-08-10, Screenshot_20260810_220759 + 220051). The auditing
  card's paragraph spacer `WORKER_TEXT_SPACER` was a dim `│ ·` hairline;
  renderers that drop box-drawing glyphs (π-web) showed a lone `·` on its own
  line. The spacer is now a non-breaking space: still non-empty (pi-tui skips
  truly empty widget lines) but invisible in every renderer. Separately, the
  user flagged cramped text in the pi-subagents Agents panel rows
  (`description · stats`); pi-subagents' dist + src now join with two spaces
  around `·` (`  ·  `) in agent-widget.ts/index.ts row builders and stat lines.

### Jiti `export let state` binding split froze persistence and broke activation
  (`audit/JITI-STATE-BINDING-SPLIT-2026-08-10.md`). pi's extension loader (jiti
  2.7.0, moduleCache:false) compiles `export let state` with a captured-value
  export binding: after `replaceState(next)` every importer of `state` kept the
  original object, so persisted ledger lines froze on the first-read state;
  `/list audit` wrote sidecars + events but never activated. Fix: goal-state.ts
  exports `const state` and replaceState() mutates in place (delete-then-
  assign) — imported bindings stay current under any loader. Regression test
  `tests/repro-jiti-state-split.test.mjs` loads the extension through jiti
  under node (`npm run test:jiti`) and fails on the pre-fix code.

### Faulty-objective recovery gate
  (`audit/FAULTY-OBJECTIVE-RECOVERY-2026-08-10.md`). Suspicious objectives are
  now checked before manual/startup resume, pre-activation list selection,
  stored completion-audit retry, continuation retry, stall, length, and final
  dispatch paths. Original/user-seed provenance, pending verification context,
  task intent, prior repair history, and auditor-approved completion context
  are consulted before a coherent repair is auto-applied with replacement
  contract, reason/evidence, and revision-before/after recording. Uncertain
  items pause and receive a safe non-recursive repair task promoted next in
  the disk-first queue. Reviewer headings/fragments, dangling text, canceled
  and stale generations are fenced while valid objectives such as `Implement
  archive` remain untouched. Pi core/host boundaries remain unchanged.

### Prevent reviewer metadata from becoming malformed queue goals
  (`audit/REVIEWER-ARCHIVE-METADATA-GUARD-2026-08-10.md`). Automatic postaudit
  now mines only curated disapproved/error auditor reports; archived Objective
  and verification-contract metadata is excluded because it can contain
  reviewer trigger words and become truncated, contract-less `/list` items.
  Explicit manual review still includes the archive. Regression coverage pins
  the automatic/manual source split.

### Validated session-start recovery for parked detached audits
  (`audit/SESSION-START-AUDIT-RECOVERY-2026-08-10.md`). A durable completion
  claim already parked as `recovery-pending` now follows the existing
  `session_start` recovery policy: a matching host handoff/rebind or explicit
  global Auto-resume starts one fresh detached-auditor retry, while ordinary
  cold/manual startup remains paused for `/goal resume`. No stale context is
  used to create a session, and Pi host/process replacement remains out of
  scope. Behavioral coverage pins validated handoff recovery, Auto-resume, and
  no-blind-resend/manual-hold paths.

## 0.34.121 — close auditor lifecycle gaps in cancel, wipe, and blank startup
  (v0.34.121, audit/OBJECTIVE-LIFECYCLE-FOLLOWUP-2026-08-09.md). `/glla
  cancel` now stops an active loop before considering unrelated waiting list
  work. `/glla wipe` treats provider recovery and continuation-dispatch state
  as live artifacts: its clean fast path sees them, and confirmed cleanup
  clears their timers, in-memory state, main sidecar, and atomic temp sidecars.
  Archive failure still preserves resumable work. Legacy terminal-slot cleanup
  now runs before the blank-start transcript barrier returns. New behavioral
  regressions cover all three auditor objections.

## 0.34.120 — objective lifecycle closure, conflict confirmation, and one-pass wipe
  (v0.34.120, audit/OBJECTIVE-LIFECYCLE-2026-08-09.md). Approved objectives
  now persist their final recap in the archive, show exactly one final `✓ done`
  summary, and clear the live slot automatically; legacy terminal slots close
  on session start. A new same-mode objective never silently overwrites live
  work: users choose Update current objective, Replace current objective, or
  Cancel new objective; cross-mode starts require explicit replacement. The
  guard covers `/goal`, `/loop`, `/list next`, `list_activate`, and drafting
  tools, with stale-dialog identity revalidation. `/glla cancel` now gives a
  standalone live goal precedence over unrelated waiting backlog, while
  list-owned cancellation still drops its queue. `/glla wipe` is now truly
  one-pass and Confirm-gated: it archives safely, clears terminal live state,
  removes RAM/orphan queue sidecars, persists clean state before scratch-branch
  cleanup, and refuses to claim success on archive/deletion failures. Updated
  docs and raw external-review evidence; pi core/host changes remain out of
  scope.

## 0.34.119 — note.md triage: objective cancel, summary canonicalization, truthful stale-ctx recovery
  (v0.34.119, audit/NOTE-REMAINING-TRIAGE-2026-08-09.md). Re-audited
  every item in `/home/dracon/chat/pi/note.md` and added regression coverage.
  `complete_goal` now validates impossible pass-count summaries BEFORE
  persisting the pending detached-audit claim, so the canonical warning
  reaches the auditor and all retries. `/glla cancel` now cancels the
  active objective: an active list item plus its waiting queue; standalone
  goals and loops keep their own paths. Approved list completion now has an
  integration test proving durable archive + `goal_archived(status=complete)`
  + exactly-one next-item activation. Corrected stale-ctx UX: pi's public
  event `ExtensionContext` does not expose `newSession`, and `ExtensionAPI`
  never did; v0.34.117's cast could not auto-recover on the real SDK. The
  helper now checks the actual context capability, never claims automatic
  recovery when absent, and stale guidance says `/new` rather than the
  misleading `/reload`. The note audit records the remaining pi-side API
  limitation, external-review fetch results, non-reproducible refresh icon
  issue, and current auditor/stacked-thread evidence.

## 0.34.118 — dedicated Backups segment + forbidden-aware ordered picker
  (v0.34.118, audit/BACKUPS-PICKER-2026-08-09.md). `/glla settings`
  now has a dedicated `Backups` segment rather than burying main-model
  recovery beside Keep-going controls. Main model backups, retry cadence,
  and glla-managed subagent fallback chains are grouped there. The ordered
  model picker now hides refs from `forbiddenModels` when selecting backups,
  hides current backups when editing `forbiddenModels`, and removes the
  no-op session/manual rows from multi-select backup lists. The same mutual
  exclusion is enforced in headless/free-form input mode. New tests pin
  picker filtering, six-tab grouping, and both editor paths.

## 0.34.117 — fresh-session auto-recovery on stale ctx (historical claim; superseded by v0.34.119)
  (v0.34.117, audit/STALE-CTX-AUTO-RECOVERY-2026-08-09.md). Pi's compact
  subsystem holds a cached ctx; once it goes stale ("This extension ctx
  is stale after session replacement or reload") EVERY sendMessage
  throws in-process. The user-observed symptom (Screenshot_20260809_095353,
  capture-anime-girls field) was that /reload shares the same ctx and does
  NOT help; only /new clears it — until now, the user had to type /new by
  hand. New `extensions/goal-recovery.ts::attemptFreshSessionRecovery` calls
  The original implementation attempted `ctx.newSession()` (the programmatic
  equivalent of /new) when the stale
  signature fires. All 5 `isStaleApiError` catch sites (`retryContinuationDispatch`,
  `sendContinuation`, `sendStallEscalation`, `sendLengthContinue`, `sendLoopTurn`)
  route through it BEFORE falling back to the legacy `goStaleTerminal` park
  — **v0.34.119 correction:** `ExtensionAPI.newSession()` does not exist and
  autonomous event contexts do not expose `newSession`; the real current path
  truthfully parks and directs the user to `/new`. The terminal park stays as
  the fallback until pi exposes a host-level replacement hook. Ledger events:
  `fresh_session_recovery_triggered` (fired + session_start will rehydrate
  from .pi-glla/); `fresh_session_recovery_skipped` (entrypoint missing);
  `fresh_session_recovery_failed` (entrypoint threw). New
  `tests/fresh-session-auto-recovery.test.ts` (4 source-pin tests, all
  pass). Existing `tests/stale-api-terminal.test.ts` + `tests/length-continue.test.ts`
  updated to pin the new auto-recovery pattern. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean;
  `bun test` → 1192 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail (up from 1188 in v0.34.116).

  Retroactive ship marker (same session, follow-up to v0.34.117): the
  v0.34.116 work originally landed in two auto-cycler commits without
  paired tags. `v0.34.116` (annotated) → `aa38bac1` (the release commit
  where package.json was bumped to 0.34.116); empty
  `Ship v0.34.116: …` commit → `v0.34.116-ship` (annotated). Both pushed
  to origin. Audit doc updated with the retroactive-ship section.
  `extensions/loops/goal.ts` ≤ 700 lines (387).

## 0.34.116 — context-overflow fallback + /reload copy + stale-ctx one-liner
  (v0.34.116, audit/SESSION-COMPACT-FALLBACK-2026-08-09.md). When pi's
  `session_compact` cannot release the prompt (the model is smaller than
  the prompt needs), glla now walks the fallback chain to a larger-context
  backup instead of leaving the user stuck on "Context overflow recovery
  FAILED after one compact-and-retry attempt" (hegemion 2026-08-08 case).
  New `MainModelFailureKind = "context-overflow"` (gated by an
  `isContextOverflow` override on `classifyMainModelFailure` — a length
  cap mid-stream STILL classifies as non-recoverable; the override is the
  explicit "compaction already tried, model is too small" signal).
  New `extensions/goal-recovery.ts::observeCompactFailure` /
  `recoverFromContextOverflow` (the one-liner surface + the chain walk —
  reuses the existing `sessionModelSelector` from v0.34.115). The
  `agent_end` context-starved branch detects "compaction already happened
  within `COMPACTION_GRACE_MS`" (180s) and walks the chain before yielding
  to pi. Stale-handle status-bar copy now reads `· /reload (or a fresh
  session_start) rebinds` (the underlying `claimSessionOwnerAndDetectRebind`
  already rebinds on `/reload`; the user-facing copy was misleading).
  New `tests/context-overflow-recovery.test.ts` (7 source-pin tests).
  `tests/length-continue.test.ts` window bumped 3400 → 5000 chars
  (the new branch added ~1100 chars inside the `contextStarvedLength`
  block; the inner early-return contract is unchanged).
  `tests/stale-interrupt-resume.test.ts` updated for the new copy.
  `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `bun test` → 1188 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail
  (up from 1181). `extensions/loops/goal.ts` ≤ 700 lines (387).

## 0.34.115 — multi-select model picker + unified model-selector
### 0.34.115 — multi-select model picker + unified model-selector
  (v0.34.115, audit/MODEL-PICKER-MULTI-SELECT-2026-08-09.md). New
  `extensions/multi-model-picker.ts` (multi-select variant of the existing
  picker, space to toggle, enter/tab to confirm, ordered selection).
  New `extensions/model-selector.ts` — a scope-aware selector
  (`{kind:"session"} | {kind:"subagent", agentName}`) that composes the
  existing main-model-recovery helpers for ONE chain-walk contract
  reused by both session and per-subagent fallback paths. Three settings
  editors now drive the picker instead of a free-form text dump:
  mainModelFallbacks, forbiddenModels, and the new subagentFallbacks
  (per-agent fallback chain written to the override .md via
  `resolveSubagentOverrideRef`). `DEFAULT_FORBIDDEN_MODELS` is now empty
  (the previous opinionated `["gpt-5.5", "sonnet", "opus"]` shipped as
  policy and conflicted with rigs that rely on those models — the
  blockForbiddenModelSwitches gate is still ON by default, users add
  explicit refs via the picker). `goal-recovery.ts` consumes the
  selector; the existing forbidden-gate walk becomes a single
  `selectNextValid` call that records every ref visited under a unified
  `model_fallback_select {scope, fromRef, toRef, reason}` ledger event
  (reason ∈ ok | forbidden | unregistered | exhausted). 35 new tests
  (15 picker + 20 selector). tsc clean; suite 1181 pass / 1 skip /
  0 fail. Repo hygiene: `.pi-glla/` is now gitignored and untracked
  (per v0.34.115 release contract — runtime state is per-session,
  not source-of-truth); release history v0.34.113 / v0.34.114 / v0.34.115
  is rewritten to three clean commits with no .pi-glla noise.

### 0.34.114 — decomposition step 6: goal.ts real thin installer
  (v0.34.114, audit/GOAL-INSTALLER-THINNING-2026-08-09.md). The public
  `extensions/loops/goal.ts` entrypoint is now a 387-line real activation /
  wiring surface (≤700-line contract satisfied), and the remaining runtime
  concerns moved into named sibling modules under `extensions/loops/`:
  `goal-session.ts`, `goal-ui.ts`, `goal-orchestrator.ts`,
  `goal-auditor-hooks.ts`, `goal-list-queue.ts`, `goal-tools.ts`,
  `goal-settings-ui.ts`, `goal-activation.ts`, plus the explicit
  `goal-runtime-globals.ts` compatibility bridge for preserving the old
  monolith lexical links during the split. `goal.ts` contains the actual
  `createGoalContinuation(continuationFlags, continuationDeps)` call (not a
  re-export façade), starts the heartbeat/UI ticker, and delegates command/tool
  and lifecycle registration to the extracted activation module. There is no
  `extensions/loops/goal-runtime.ts` monolith. Source-pinned tests now read a
  live source corpus helper over the real split files; expectations remain
  pinned to the moved runtime strings. Suite: 1146 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail, tsc
  clean.

### 0.34.113 — decomposition step 5: extensions/goal-continuation.ts extracted
  (v0.34.113, audit/GOAL-CONTINUATION-EXTRACTION-2026-08-09.md). The
  continuation cluster — `scheduleContinuation`/`sendContinuation`,
  `sendStallEscalation`/`sendLengthContinue`, the dispatch sidecar lifecycle
  (`dispatchPrepare`/`dispatchAccepted`/`dispatchStartAcknowledged`/
  `dispatchFailed`/`dispatchStartUnacknowledged`/`retryContinuationDispatch`),
  the continuation-start watchdog (30s + 60s retry, compaction rearm cap),
  send-rearm storm accounting (`accountSendRearm`/`escalateSendRearmStorm`/
  `sendRearmDelayMs`), queue-stuck probe, `buildPostCompactResync` and
  `continuationPrompt` — moved from `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (7,683 →
  7,054 lines) into the new `extensions/goal-continuation.ts` (962 lines,
  ≤2,000). Continuation-owned module state (timers, dispatch sidecar, rearm
  counters) lives in the new module; goal.ts observes it only through
  accessors (`continuationTimerPending`, `pendingContinuationDispatchRef`,
  …); goal.ts-owned lets pass in via `ContinuationFlags` accessors and
  functions via `ContinuationDeps`. Zero behavior change: ledger event names
  unchanged, moved bodies byte-identical except mechanical `flags.X`
  re-spellings. Real bug fixed by the move: `continuationPrompt`'s template
  path depth corrected for the new file location (`extensions/` vs
  `extensions/loops/`). 9 test files re-anchored to `CONT` pins; re-spelled
  pins updated (`continuationTimer === null` → `!continuationTimerPending()`),
  never weakened. Suite: 1146 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail, tsc clean.

### 0.34.112 — decomposition step 4: extensions/goal-heartbeat.ts extracted
  (v0.34.112, audit/GOAL-HEARTBEAT-EXTRACTION-2026-08-09.md). The heartbeat
  watchdog cluster — `heartbeatTick`, `startHeartbeat`, the subagent-hang
  machinery (`upsertSubagentHangProbe` / `markSubagentHangProgress` /
  `endSubagentHangProbe` / `classifyHungSubagents`), the zombie-run and
  wedge/latch watchdogs, and the five heartbeat test hooks — moved from
  `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (8,162 → 7,683 lines) into the new
  `extensions/goal-heartbeat.ts` (702 lines, ≤2,000). goal.ts owns the 28
  heartbeat flags and observes them through `HeartbeatFlags` accessors;
  the 15 dependencies + 2 continuation-unanswered values pass in via
  `HeartbeatDeps`. Zero behavior change: ledger event names unchanged.
  11 test files re-anchored to `HEARTBEAT_SRC` pins (flags.X re-spelling,
  pins never weakened). Suite: 1146 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail (×2), tsc clean.

### 0.34.111 — decomposition step 3: extensions/goal-recovery.ts extracted

Third extraction per docs/GLLA-POSITIONING-AND-DECOMPOSITION-2026-08-08.md
sequencing — the recovery machinery (compat sidecar, main-model recovery
envelope, hourly quota probe, completion-audit recovery) leaves the monolith,
zero behavior change.

- New `extensions/goal-recovery.ts` (696 lines): `createGoalRecovery(flags, deps)`
  factory + mirror-lets pattern (same as v0.34.110). 22 functions moved and
  exported; 12 module flags observed via `RecoveryFlags` accessor; 11
  goal.ts-owned functions passed via `RecoveryDeps`.
- goal.ts: 8,643 → 8,162 lines.
- recovery ledger event names unchanged (now emitted from goal-recovery.ts).
- 6 source pins in 5 test files re-anchored (retry-bounds, hourly-quota-probe,
  quota-wall-engagement, blocked-pause-autoclear, mode-command-guidance).

### 0.34.110 — decomposition step 2: goal-commands.ts + goal-loop.ts extracted

Second extraction per docs/GLLA-POSITIONING-AND-DECOMPOSITION-2026-08-08.md
sequencing — the command surface and the loop machinery leave the monolith,
zero behavior change.

- New `extensions/goal-commands.ts` (1,991 lines): `createGoalCommands(deps)`
  factory + mirrored exports — cmdResume/cmdCancel/cmdList/cmdSettings/
  cmdGllaWipe/cmdGllaResume/cmdGllaStatus/cmdLog/cmdSet/cmdToolOverride/
  cmdReviewerSettings, maybeDecisionPopup, addSingleItem, enqueueItems,
  recentlyCompletedObjectives, probeAutoNotify, stale-entry gates,
  subtask validation refusals, `Unknown /glla action`.
- New `extensions/goal-loop.ts` (1,071 lines): `createGoalLoop(deps)` factory
  + mirrors — sendLoopTurn, runLoopTick, finishLoopGit, cmdLoop (incl.
  `/loop finish`), startLoopFromConfig, spec_item_progress accounting,
  divergence walk, loop rearm/backoff, `loopTimerPending()` helper.
- goal.ts: 11,415 → 8,643 lines; one-way imports only; moved bodies
  byte-identical except mechanical `flags.X` accessor re-spellings and
  `loopTimer === null` → `!loopTimerPending()`.
- Ledger event names unchanged; loop_turn_sent / loop_turn_send_failed
  now emitted from goal-loop.ts, list_duplicate_skipped from
  goal-commands.ts, everything else stays put.
- 16 test files re-anchored (mechanical source-pin re-spellings only, no
  expectation edits). Suite: 1146 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail; tsc clean.

### 0.34.109 — decomposition step 1: goal-state.ts owns the state singleton

First extraction per docs/GLLA-POSITIONING-AND-DECOMPOSITION-2026-08-08.md
sequencing. Invariant #2: the mutable `state` object has ONE owner.

- New `extensions/goal-state.ts`: `export let state: State = { goal: null }`
  (the singleton), `replaceState(next)` (wholesale replacement primitive),
  and `persistStateLine(cwd, s)` (the ledger `state`-line write — the
  persistence core). goal.ts imports the binding and the primitive.
- goal.ts: the local `let state: State = { goal: null }` declaration is
  gone; all 18 wholesale `state = ...` sites now route through
  `replaceState(...)` (ESM import bindings are read-only, so a stray
  reassignment would be a tsc error — the pin test enforces it too).
  `persistState` wraps `persistStateLine` with its UI side effects
  (notifyPersistenceState / refreshUI) unchanged.
- Module-level mutable flags deliberately stay in goal.ts (invariant #3) —
  setGoal / updateGoal / archiveCurrentGoal / autoArbitrateStackedState are
  NOT moved yet; they reset ~10 flags that belong to goal.ts's clusters and
  will move in later steps with their owning code.
- Tests: new tests/goal-state.test.ts (4 pins: single declaration, no
  stray `state =` reassignments, persistence core location, spot-checked
  converted sites); disk-first-queue.test.ts pins re-spelled to the
  replaceState form (intent unchanged — sidecar-before-commit ordering).

Suite: 1146 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail (103 files); tsc clean.

### 0.34.108 — guidance literals fixed + dead-code sweep (audit findings)

Findings from the 2026-08-08 source audit (subagent c6206c9d, v0.34.105
baseline): the seven hardcoded `/goal <verb>` literals in generated
recovery/pause guidance, and dead code left by three refactors.

1. Mode-command-guidance contract (7 sites fixed): every recovery guidance
   path (manual-hold pause action, wait-park, complete_goal tool text,
   session_start recovery notifies, quota-claim wait, restore hint) now
   interpolates through `recoverySurfaceCommand(kind, command)` /
   `activeGoalSurfaceCommand(command)` instead of hardcoding
   `/goal|/list|/loop resume` ternaries. `recoverySurfaceCommand` is the
   loop-aware extension of `activeGoalSurfaceCommand` (the main-model
   recovery paths park a METRIC LOOP too).
2. Source-pin blind spot closed: mode-command-guidance.test.ts only scanned
   lines carrying guidance trigger tokens (pauseSuggestedAction/notify(/…),
   so a literal parked on a `const resumeCmd = ...` assignment line escaped.
   The pin now also scans const/let assignment lines; new pin asserts
   recovery guidance never hardcodes `/loop resume` on assignment lines.
3. Dead-code sweep (audit §1): removed `runGoalCompletionAuditor`
   (goal-loop-auditor.ts, superseded by the detached worker path) plus its
   private machinery (`makeAuditorResourceLoader`, `modelLabel`, dead
   imports); 4 never-called `__testOnly*` hooks (ResetStallState,
   SetHourlyProbeNow, ResetHourlyProbe, HourlyProbeState) + the
   `hourlyProbeClockOverride` they were the only readers of; dead locals
   `quotaRetryStreak` (written 4×, never read), `SEND_REARM_ESCALATE_AFTER_MS`
   (superseded by `sendStormEscalateMs()`), `consecutiveNoToolIterations`;
   8 unused goal.ts imports; display.ts dead helpers `sinceIso`/`stateBadge`/
   `shortClock` and the unused `auditorPhase` computation. Affected source
   pins were re-anchored to the production path (goal-loop-auditor-process.ts
   + scripts/goal-auditor-worker.mjs) — the invariants they guarded (infra
   failures never disapproved, abort listeners removed, worker children
   killed on teardown, no inline pairing outside the pure function) all
   still hold in the detached path.

### 0.34.107 — audit/ organization (INDEX.md + pre-0.34.80 docs archived)
### 0.34.105 — field: subagent hang watchdog blinded by main-model quota recovery

Live field case (2026-08-08 ~16:18): an audit subagent hit the MiniMax
Token-Plan 429 wall while the MAIN model was also in recovery (18
`main_model_recovery_wait` ledger entries). `heartbeatTick` returned
early at `if (mainModelRecoveryActive()) return;` BEFORE the subagent
hang scan, so the frozen subagent (12+ min, zero new progress) produced
ZERO `subagent_hang_detected` entries — the watchdog was blind exactly
when a shared-provider quota wall freezes subagent + main model at the
same time.

Fix: moved the subagent hang scan (v0.34.85) ahead of the
`mainModelRecoveryActive()` gate in `heartbeatTick`. The scan is
detection + notify only (never an auto-kill, never a send), so it is
safe to run during main-model recovery. Two regression tests: a
behavioral one that parks the main model via 3× 429 turns and asserts
the frozen subagent still surfaces `subagent_hang_detected`, and a
source pin asserting the scan precedes the recovery gate.
### 0.34.104 — [Image-#1] list-stall settle window + completionSummary self-check

Field report (dracon-platform 2026-08-08 10:29 — the user's
"first we fix the problem" screenshot):

1. **List-item stall after audit completion.** A list item completing
   fires an auto-advance that dispatches a continuation to pi
   immediately. Pi is still settling the completion acknowledgement
   and doesn't start a turn within the v0.34.88 watchdog window
   (30s + 60s retry). The new item is declared unacknowledged and
   the queue is stuck for manual /list resume, even though pi was
   about to start a turn on its own. Fix: a bounded
   `LIST_COMPLETION_SETTLE_MS = 15s` window delays the FIRST
   continuation dispatched from the list-complete cascade; any
   agent activity during the window (`message_update`/`agent_start`/
   `turn_start`/`before_agent_start`) cancels the deferred send so a
   wake-up doesn't double-dispatch. Ledgers `list_completion_settle_armed`
   / `_settle_pending` / `_settle_cleared` for forensics. Env override
   `GLLA_LIST_COMPLETION_SETTLE_MS`.

2. **"29/28 pass" cosmetic bug.** The agent's `completionSummary`
   said "29/28 pass, 0 fail" — more tests passed than existed. The
   plugin persisted it verbatim. Fix: `validateCompletionSummary`
   scans for impossible counts (X/Y pass with X > Y, or "X tests,
   Y passed" with Y > X), ledgers `completion_summary_impossible_count`,
   and appends an honest `Counts appear inconsistent: X passed vs Y
   total` note to the recap so the user + auditor see the discrepancy.
   Clean input (X ≤ Y or no count) is returned untouched.

### 0.34.103 — GitHub #6: replace no longer silently cancels a wait goal's scheduled resume; resume answers archived goals

Field report (GitHub issue #6, filed by the detached auditor 2026-08-08):

**Defect A — replaced wait goal's auto-resume silently dropped.** When a
newly-activated goal `replace`s an older goal parked in `wait` (scheduled
`pauseResumeAt`), the old goal was archived outright and its resume intent
silently cancelled with no notification. Now `setGoal` captures the
superseded goal, and if it carried a pending scheduled resume the plugin
warns (`…was superseded and archived — its scheduled auto-resume (HH:MM)
was cancelled`) + ledgers `replaced_resume_cancelled` (goalId, policy,
scheduledAt, replacedBy). Plain replaces without a resume intent stay quiet.

**Defect B — `/goal resume` on an archived goal silently no-opped.** The
bare `if (!state.goal || status !== "paused") return;` swallowed the verb
with zero feedback. Now cmdResume answers every dead end:
- terminal (complete/aborted → archived): names the state and the recovery
  path (`/goal <objective>` fresh start + `/goal archive`, or `/list add`
  re-queue + `/list show` for list items);
- no goal at all: "Nothing to resume" + points at `/goal <objective>`,
  `/list show`, or `/loop resume` when a loop is active;
- non-terminal non-paused: informational answer via the mode-aware
  `activeGoalStatusCommand()`.

### 0.34.102 — Field-report triple fix: watchdog event-only fallback + recovering display state + no-turn diagnostic

Three field reports (pully/dracon-platform 2026-08-08, screenshots 090206/
090343/091828) traced to root causes and fixed together:

1. **Subagent-hang watchdog blind spot (pully 118-min wedge, zero detections).**
   `classifyHungSubagents` skipped every probe whose manager record was
   unreachable (`if (!rec) continue`), contradicting its own "falls back to
   event-only evidence" comment. Now a vanished record falls back to the
   probe's event trail (spawn seed + compacted/steered refreshes) against a
   longer `SUBAGENT_HANG_EVENT_ONLY_MS = 20m` window (5m record-frozen path
   unchanged). Alerts/ledger distinguish `evidence: "record-frozen"` vs
   `"event-only"`. Still detection-only — the main session decides whether to
   abort.

2. **"Working while displaying paused" (dracon-platform 090343).** A goal
   parked on `mainModelRecovery` rendered the widget head as `⏸ paused`
   while the rearm storm (streak 19) was actively working. The head chip now
   renders `⏳ recovering` and the card names the reset time; the status line
   says `⏳ parked on provider wall — no turns until quota reset at HH:MM`
   instead of promising a live retry.

3. **"pi did not start a turn" with no explanation (dracon-platform 091828).**
   A continuation rearm storm raged 68m with zero accepted dispatches, but
   `continuation_unanswered` never fired (it requires the plugin to have SENT
   a continuation — `lastContinuationSentAt > 0` — which the recovery park
   gates). The storm milestone now detects no-accepted-dispatch and surfaces
   `rearm_no_turn_started` (ledger + notify, throttled per milestone window)
   naming the provider wall and the automatic recovery.

### 0.34.101 — Auditor-as-subagent architecture (design doc only)

Field evidence (Screenshots_20260808_084527/084717 endless-td
minimax/MiniMax-M3): the user asked "the auditor keep showing
one words at a time... in fact arguably the main thread should
not be the auditor, not detached — we can just show the auditor
as a subagent we are waiting for."

That request implies a UI shape change: instead of the
detached worker (separate process, ledger-driven) rendering
muted-by-default, the auditor should run as a `Agent`-tool
sub-agent of the main session, with its prose visible in the
sub-agent's pane.

This release is **design only**. The implementation lands
in a later goal. The deliverable is
`audit/AUDITOR-AS-SUBAGENT-DESIGN.md`.

The doc covers:
- Current shape (detached worker, JSONL protocol, side-files)
- Proposed shape (sub-agent via `Agent` tool, sub-agent pane)
- Trade-offs (visual, cost, isolation, hung detection,
  failure modes, session restart, quota impact, forbidden-
  model risk)
- Migration plan (3 phases: design → opt-in flag → default
  flip + retire worker)
- Risks (5: sub-agent context exhaustion, model mismatch,
  UI pane availability, concurrent audits, worker vs
  sub-agent hooks)
- User-facing changes (the widget's muted line disappears;
  the verdict notify references the sub-agent pane; a
  settings toggle)

- **No code change** in v0.34.101. The detached worker
  remains the implementation.
- **Suite**: still 1119 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail (no test
  changes). `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `audit/AUDITOR-AS-SUBAGENT-DESIGN.md`
  (new, 12 KB), `package.json` (0.34.100 → 0.34.101),
  `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry).

### 0.34.100 — Auditor report-stream muted default verification across session models

Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_084527/084717 endless-td
minimax/MiniMax-M3): the auditor's report stream was muted by
default in the widget — `report stream muted — final text at
verdict` rendered in the card during the audit run, the prose
tail was hidden. The user wanted verification that this default
applies across session models, not just for MiniMax-M3.

The fix is verification: the silent default was already wired
(v0.34.66 + v0.34.86). This release adds regression tests that
pin the contract:

- **Default ON** (`extensions/goal-settings.ts:189`):
  `auditorSilent: true` in `DEFAULT_GLOBAL_SETTINGS`. /glla
  settings exposes the toggle.
- **Plumbing** (`extensions/loops/goal.ts:1647`):
  `auditorSilent: loadSettings(ctx.cwd).auditorSilent !== false`
  threads the loaded setting into `extras.auditorSilent`. The
  `!== false` check means `undefined` defaults to ON — a session
  with no explicit setting gets the silent default.
- **Display** (`extensions/goal-loop-display.ts:966`):
  `const silent = extras?.auditorSilent !== false` — same pattern.
- **New tests** in `tests/display.test.ts`, +3 cases:
  - default is on in settings (regression pin for
    `auditorSilent: true,`)
  - plumbing threads the loaded setting through extras
  - silent-default widget renders muted for ANY session model
    (tested with MiniMax-M3, Anthropic Sonnet, OpenAI GPT-4.1,
    and undefined — all muted)
- **Suite**: 1119 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `tests/display.test.ts` (+3 tests, +40 LOC),
  `package.json` (0.34.99 → 0.34.100), `CHANGELOG.md` (this
  entry), `audit/AUDITOR-SILENT-DEFAULT-2026-08-08.md` (new).

### 0.34.99 — Quota prompt verbosity (CLOSED via v0.34.92)

The original complaint was that the v0.34.58 hourly quota-resume
prompt was verbose: the chat message dumped the full turn snapshot
(`goal: <objective> — main model quota: 429 rate limit: ...`) into
the chat, which was useful for debugging but awful for the user.

The v0.34.92 reversal removed the whole quota-prompt surface — the
plugin never says "Provider quota wall" in chat anymore. The
verbosity complaint is therefore moot: there is no message to be
verbose. The hourly ticker (also added in v0.34.92) gives the same
fast pickup without any chat text.

- **No code change** in v0.34.99. The v0.34.92 entry is the fix.
- **Suite**: unchanged (1116 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail). `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/QUOTA-PROMPT-REMOVED-2026-08-08.md` (already covers the
  verbosity removal as part of the broader quota-prompt removal).

### 0.34.98 — Paused-without-draft / decision surface: long-wait pauses (> 6h) surface a tweak offer

Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_080402 hellhunter): a goal
paused with `kind="wait"` and `resumeAt=2026-08-08T02:00:00Z` —
the user couldn't unblock without re-issuing the same objective
later. A 6+ hour wait effectively locks the user out of progress
for the entire workday.

The fix: at `pause_goal` time, when the pause is `kind="wait"` or
`kind="blocked"` AND `resumeAt` is more than 6 hours away, surface
a one-shot notify offering the tweak path:

> "Pause scheduled for ~Nh. If the objective no longer matches your
> intent, run /goal tweak (or /list tweak) to replace it now;
> otherwise /goal resume continues automatically when the wait
> ends."

This is an OFFER, not an auto-apply. The user keeps full control:
they can ignore the offer and wait as planned, or run the tweak
command to pivot the objective without waiting for the resumeAt.

- **Gating**: strictly `> SIX_HOURS_MS` (6h × 60min × 60s × 1000ms).
  6h exactly does NOT trigger — the boundary is conservative so a
  slightly-long wait doesn't spam the user.
- **Kinds covered**: `wait` (time-gated) and `blocked` (generic
  blocked with a resumeAt). Decision pauses (`decision` kind) don't
  carry a `resumeAt` — they need an explicit user pick — and are
  excluded.
- **Ledger event** `pause_long_wait_offer_tweak` records the
  pause + hours for auditing. The event is `info`-level: it tells
  the user the offer fired without spamming chat (one notify per
  state transition).
- **New tests** in `tests/pause-informativeness.test.ts`, +2 cases:
  - long-wait pause (> 6h): the SIX_HOURS_MS constant is present,
    the longWait gate is present, the notify text mentions both
    the wait duration and the tweak path, the ledger event
    records hours.
  - short-wait pause (≤ 6h): the gate is strictly `>` not `>=`,
    so 6h exactly does not fire the offer.
- **Suite**: 1116 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (+30 LOC for the
  longWait block + notify + ledger event),
  `tests/pause-informativeness.test.ts` (+2 tests, +30 LOC),
  `package.json` (0.34.97 → 0.34.98), `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/PAUSED-DECISION-SURFACE-2026-08-08.md` (new).

### 0.34.97 — Compaction-not-visible-until-reload: '⏳ compacting…' chip paints while the grace window is open

Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_003007/003024 ai-auto-writer):
222,368 tokens compacted mid-turn, but the user only saw
`[compaction]` AFTER a reload — the session_compact event fired
in-process but no in-process UI surface told the user what just
happened. The fix has two parts:

- **An info notification on session_compact** ("glla: session
  compacting — stall counter reset, grace timer started. The widget
  will show ⏳ compacting… for the next 3 minutes."). The notify is
  best-effort (try/catch around stale ctx); the durable record is
  the `session_compact` ledger event the handler already writes.
- **A `⏳ compacting… (X ago)` chip on the status line** for 3
  minutes after the compaction. The chip survives a reload because
  `lastCompactionAt` is now persisted on `State`
  (`extensions/goal-loop-core.ts:684`).

- **State field** `lastCompactionAt?: number` — epoch (ms) of the
  most recent session_compact. Persisted via `persistState` so the
  chip survives reload. Set by the session_compact handler
  (`extensions/loops/goal.ts:9877`).
- **Status-line chip** in `buildStatusText` — when
  `state.lastCompactionAt` is within the last 3 minutes (matches
  `COMPACTION_GRACE_MS`), the chip renders at the top of the active
  branch. Outside the window, no chip — the compaction has finished
  settling.
- **New tests** in `tests/display.test.ts`, +3 cases:
  - Within grace: chip renders with elapsed time
  - Past grace (200s ago, > 180s threshold): no chip
  - No `lastCompactionAt` on state: no chip (no false signal)
- **Suite**: 1114 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (+12 LOC for the
  notify + state persist), `extensions/goal-loop-core.ts` (+7 LOC for
  the State field), `extensions/goal-loop-display.ts` (+9 LOC for
  the chip), `tests/display.test.ts` (+3 tests, +37 LOC),
  `package.json` (0.34.96 → 0.34.97), `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/COMPACTION-VISIBLE-2026-08-08.md` (new).

### 0.34.96 — Complete-vs-aborted distinction when the work was already shipped in a prior version

Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_080536): an agent's
completionSummary ended `✓ complete` while saying "v0.34.74 already…",
two contradictory surfaces — the goal's `status=complete` claimed the
work was done in THIS turn, while the recap named a prior version.
The user wants a way to differentiate "completed" from
"verified-already-shipped".

The fix: detect "already shipped" / "verified vX.Y.Z covers this" /
"no new work shipped" in the completionSummary at the
`complete_goal` entry point and route to `status=aborted` with
`stopReason=already_shipped:vX.Y.Z`. The auditor never runs (there
is nothing for it to verify); the user sees an honest terminal state
("no new work shipped in this turn") instead of a misleading
`✓ complete` with a recap that names a version, not this turn.

- **Detection patterns** (case-insensitive on the completionSummary):
  - `already shipped`
  - `verified vX.Y.Z covers this`
  - `no new work shipped`
  The regex captures the matched phrase; an additional regex pulls
  `vX.Y.Z` from the summary text for the `stopReason`.
- **Routing**: when matched, the goal's `status` becomes `aborted`,
  `stopReason` becomes `already_shipped:<matched>` (e.g.
  `already_shipped:v0.34.74` or `already_shipped:already shipped`
  when no version is named). The completionSummary is preserved as
  the abort reason so `/goal status` shows the full text.
- **Ledger event** `complete_goal_already_shipped` records the
  matched phrase, matched version (if any), and a 300-char recap
  excerpt. This is the durable record — the user can grep the
  ledger to find all "already shipped" aborts.
- **UI notify**: an `info` notification tells the user
  "Goal archived as aborted — completionSummary indicated the
  work was <matched phrase>; no new work shipped in this turn."
- **New tests** in `tests/revision-bound-audit.test.ts`, +3 cases:
  - "already shipped" / "verified v0.34.74 covers this" → routes
    to aborted, no auditor runs
  - "no new work shipped" → routes to aborted with stopReason
    `already_shipped:no new work shipped`
  - A NORMAL completionSummary ("Shipped v0.34.95 work: ...")
    still runs the auditor (no false-positive abort — the gate
    only fires on the specific phrases)
- **Suite**: 1111 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (+60 LOC for the
  detection + routing + UI notify + ledger entry + comment),
  `tests/revision-bound-audit.test.ts` (+3 tests, +75 LOC),
  `package.json` (0.34.95 → 0.34.96), `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/ABORTED-VS-COMPLETE-2026-08-08.md` (new).

### 0.34.95 — Status transparency when parked on quota: '[QUEUED] 12m 26s · N queued' → '… · waiting for quota reset at HH:MM'

Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_014303 darklord LIST-AUDIT-COLLECT):
the status line rendered `[QUEUED] 12m 26s` with no WHY — the user
couldn't tell whether the queue was stalled on quota, on a slow
provider, or just idle. The fix: when the goal is in the QUEUED state
AND `state.mainModelRecovery` is set (the bounded envelope is parked),
the status line appends `· waiting for quota reset at HH:MM` after
the queue depth. No chat spam, no extra prompt — the existing
status line just says what's blocking.

- **New helper** `formatClockTime(epochMs)` in
  `extensions/goal-loop-display.ts`: returns local `HH:MM` from an
  absolute epoch. Used by the quota-recovery status line so the user
  can glance at the clock and see when the next probe will fire.
- **Status line change** (`buildStatusText`):
  `glla: [QUEUED] 12m 26s · 5 queued` →
  `glla: [QUEUED] 12m 26s · 5 queued · waiting for quota reset at 14:30`.
  The `quotaSuffix` only renders when both:
  - `activity === "queued"` (the user can't tell work is happening), AND
  - `state.mainModelRecovery` is set with a `retryAt` (the envelope
    is parked with a known next-probe time).
  A LIVE/WORKING or ACTIVE state with recovery set renders normally
  (the live badge already names the work).
- **No chat spam**: this release is purely a status-line tweak. The
  v0.34.92 quota-prompt removal stays — the recovery envelope handles
  everything else (v0.34.79 eager first probe + v0.34.84 hour-aligned
  attempts 2+ + v0.34.92 hourly probe ticker).
- **New tests** in `tests/display.test.ts`, +3 cases:
  - `[QUEUED]` + `mainModelRecovery.retryAt` set → status line
    includes `waiting for quota reset at HH:MM`
  - `[QUEUED]` without recovery → status line is unchanged (no false
    signal — the user only sees quota text when actually parked)
  - `[LIVE · WORKING]` with recovery → status line does NOT include
    quota text (only the QUEUED state needs the WHY)
- **Suite**: 1108 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/goal-loop-display.ts` (+28 LOC for
  `formatClockTime` + the `blockedByQuota` / `quotaSuffix` block),
  `tests/display.test.ts` (+3 tests, +60 LOC), `package.json` (0.34.94
  → 0.34.95), `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/STATUS-TRANSPARENCY-2026-08-08.md` (new).

### 0.34.94 — Host-session-lost self-heal: heartbeat re-binds in-memory state when the raw probe says pi is fresh

Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_080109, 080230, 080248 darklord /
hegemon): pi invalidated the extension handle WITHOUT delivering a
replacement session — `silent_handle_death` in the
`session_handle_invalidated` ledger's `reason` field. The plugin sat
with `staleTerminalDone=true` and `extensionApiStale=true` forever, the
user had to manually restart pi. The heartbeat's raw probe is now
treated as evidence of recovery: when `probeExtensionApiStaleRaw()`
returns false (pi is fresh) but `staleTerminalDone` is still latched,
the heartbeat clears the stale flags and calls
`tryAbsorbHostSuccessor(knownCtx, "heartbeat-self-heal")`.

No sends are re-queued. The path only resets in-memory flags and
absorbs — no `scheduleContinuation` / `sendMessage` / etc. fires from
the self-heal branch. That keeps the **no-blind-queue-storm**
guarantee the contract named: transient misses don't cause the queue
to spin; the heartbeat just unblocks future events from a fresh ctx.

- **New ledger event** `stale_terminal_recovered_via_probe` records
  every self-heal.
- **New info notification** "glla: pi recovered after a stale-handle
  terminal — self-healing in-memory state (no /reload needed)."
  notifies the user when the recovery lands. Wrapped in try/catch so
  a still-stale ctx doesn't break the recovery.
- **New test** in `tests/stale-api-terminal.test.ts`: the self-heal
  ledger event fires, the stale flags are cleared, the absorb is
  attempted, and the heartbeat region contains NO `scheduleContinuation`
  / `sendMessage` calls (the queue-storm guard).
- **Suite**: 1105 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (+18 LOC for the
  self-heal block in `heartbeatTick`),
  `tests/stale-api-terminal.test.ts` (+1 test, +24 LOC), `package.json`
  (0.34.93 → 0.34.94), `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/HOST-SESSION-LOST-SELF-HEAL-2026-08-08.md` (new).

### 0.34.93 — Forbidden-models gate on main-model fallback + recovery-probe target resolution

The auditor fallback chain (`resolveAuditorModel`, v0.34.72) consults
`isForbiddenModel` before rotating; the main-model fallback chain did
not. Field evidence (Screenshot_20260808_083612 endless-td): a session
running on `minimax/MiniMax-M3` rotated to Anthropic during recovery,
produced "Anthropic stream ended without a stop reason" repeatedly,
and burned provider quota on a model the user had explicitly forbidden.
The user's read was sharp: **"we switched model to anthropic that is a
mistake. this could be a very costly importu decision. I think it should
be disallowed."**

Two paths now consult `isForbiddenModel` before `setModel`:

- **`tryMainModelFallback`** (`extensions/loops/goal.ts:2867`) — the
  bounded fallback chain that iterates `mainModelFallbackRefs` after a
  recoverable failure. Forbidden refs are silently skipped (one
  `forbidden_model_fallback_blocked` ledger entry each) and the loop
  continues to the next candidate. If every configured candidate is
  forbidden, recovery fails-closed: the probe retries the current model
  itself per the no-target branch — never rotating to a forbidden
  ref. Mirror of the auditor fallback's gate (v0.34.72).
- **`probeMainModelRecovery` target resolution**
  (`extensions/loops/goal.ts:3109`) — the recovery probe picks the
  first non-current target from `[recovery.primary, ...fallbacks]`. The
  gate filters out forbidden refs in that find; if every candidate is
  forbidden, the no-target fallthrough retries the current model.

The ledger event `forbidden_model_fallback_blocked` is the explicit
"the recovery envelope tried to rotate to this forbidden ref, but the
gate caught it" record. Existing `forbidden_model_switch` events (the
`observeModelChange` ledger entries) continue to fire on the
unrelated observer path — both events co-exist.

- **New tests** (`tests/model-switch.test.ts`, +2 cases): the v0.34.93
  helpers (sonnet/opus/gpt-5.5 substring match) catch the user's
  Screenshot_20260808_083612 scenario; empty / undefined refs are
  never forbidden (the empty-list semantic); the policy-default
  `DEFAULT_FORBIDDEN_MODELS` list matches the same patterns.
- **Suite**: 1104 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc
  --noEmit` clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (+24 / -1 LOC for the
  two gates + the ledger entries + the explanatory comments),
  `tests/model-switch.test.ts` (+27 LOC for the two new cases),
  `package.json` (0.34.92 → 0.34.93), `CHANGELOG.md` (this entry),
  `audit/FORBIDDEN-MODEL-GATE-2026-08-08.md` (new).

Out of scope: an even-broader gate that catches every pi-internal model
rotation (the one that produced Screenshot_20260808_083612) is a
separate concern — `observeModelChange` is the only hook into pi's
model_select event stream, and the field rotation the user saw likely
bypassed it (the error stream said "Anthropic stream ended" while the
session status line still read `minimax/MiniMax-M3`, suggesting the
rotation happened mid-turn). The v0.34.93 fix narrows the exposure
window but does not eliminate it; the broader fix is a follow-up.

### 0.34.92 — Drop quota-prompt chat spam; add opt-in hourly probe ticker for faster quota pickup

The v0.34.58 hourly quota-resume prompt was the wrong shape. The plugin
scheduled a `safeSteerUser("Provider quota wall — … run /list resume")`
at the next :00 clock minute whenever main-model recovery parked — but
quota text from providers is unreliable (v0.34.64), so the plugin was
sending a chat message it couldn't reliably earn. Field evidence
(Screenshot_20260807_231717): four identical "Provider quota wall"
messages from peer sessions on one parked goal, one prompt per open pi
session, plus a fresh prompt every hour for the same parked triage item.
The user told us plainly: **"we cant check for it; just actively retry;
additionally retry after the start of every hour."**

This release removes the v0.34.90 chat-prompt machinery entirely and
adds an opt-in hourly probe ticker:

- **Removed (the whole v0.34.58/v0.34.90 quota-prompt surface)** —
  `Goal.quotaPromptedAt`, `quotaPrompt*` functions, `quotaPromptTimer`,
  `quota_prompt_scheduled` / `quota_prompt_sent` ledger events, the
  `safeSteerUser("Provider quota wall — …")` chat notify, the four
  `__testOnly*` hooks (`__testOnlySetQuotaPromptNow`,
  `__testOnlyResetQuotaPrompt`, `__testOnlyQuotaPromptState`,
  `__testOnlyFireQuotaPrompt`), and all 9 `tests/quota-prompter.test.ts`
  cases + the `audit/QUOTA-PROMPT-DEDUPE-2026-08-07.md` doc. The plugin
  never says "Provider quota wall" in chat again.
- **Added `hourlyQuotaProbe` setting (default ON)** — a periodic ticker
  that fires at `:00:30` every hour while `state.mainModelRecovery` is
  set. `:00:30` (not `:00:00`) gives the provider a 30s skew window to
  roll its quota counters before the probe; a probe at exactly `:00:00`
  can race the provider's reset. The ticker is a strict ADDITIONAL
  probe slot — the existing retry cadence is unaffected (v0.34.79 eager
  5s first probe + v0.34.84 hour-aligned attempts 2+). Opt-out: set
  `hourlyQuotaProbe: false` in `/glla` settings (the only consumer
  affected is the ticker; the normal cadence runs either way).
- **Lifecycle wiring**: `scheduleHourlyProbe` is called from
  `parkMainModelAfterFailure` (alongside the recovery timer) and from
  the `session_start` recovery-restored branch (so the new session
  re-arms after session replacement); `cancelHourlyProbe` is called
  from `mainModelRecoverySucceeded` (wall lifted) and from
  `clearMainModelRecoveryTimer` (session replacement / recovery reset).
  The new `nextHourlyProbeMs` helper returns the next `:00:30` strictly
  after now (kept the legacy `nextHourlyPromptMs` for any external
  callers that pin `:00:00`).
- **New tests** (`tests/hourly-quota-probe.test.ts`, 14 cases):
  `nextHourlyProbeMs` math (4 cases), `scheduleHourlyProbe` /
  `fireHourlyProbe` / `cancelHourlyProbe` exist, the park path calls
  `scheduleHourlyProbe` after the recovery timer, success path cancels,
  `clearMainModelRecoveryTimer` cancels in lockstep, `session_start`
  re-arms on recovery restore, the `/glla` menu exposes the on/off
  options, `hourlyQuotaProbe` defaults to ON, and the v0.34.58/v0.34.90
  machinery is GONE (module vars, functions, `__testOnly*` hooks, the
  field, the test file, the chat copy).
- **Suite**: 1102 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files. `tsc --noEmit`
  clean.
- **Files touched**: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (-250 / +90 LOC),
  `extensions/goal-loop-core.ts` (+12 LOC for the helper),
  `extensions/goal-settings.ts` (+15 LOC for the setting + default +
  menu entry), `tests/hourly-quota-probe.test.ts` (new), deletion of
  `tests/quota-prompter.test.ts` (14.5K) + `audit/QUOTA-PROMPT-DEDUPE-2026-08-07.md`.

The auto-recovery shape is unchanged: the plugin still retries on
failure with the bounded envelope (v0.34.79 eager 5s first probe,
v0.34.84 hour-aligned attempts 2+, 5h/24h horizons). What changed is
that the recovery no longer prompts the user — it just retries, with
one extra :00:30 probe slot per hour for faster pickup.

### 0.34.91 — End-of-goal voice says WHAT HAPPENED: completion recap on every terminal surface

Three screenshots in a row (Screenshot_20260808_012905 deathrun, 013220 + 013515 polis) called
out the same thing: every plugin summary at goal-complete was boilerplate about the process
("auditor approved", "claim persisted", `✓ <objective> ✓ complete · took X`) while the one
useful recap ("Goal ... SHIPPED summary: ...") was agent-prose luck, not a plugin surface.
Fix: persist the agent's `completionSummary` on the goal at complete_goal and surface it on
every end-of-goal surface — terminal widget line, settle chat notify, external notify, and
the durable goal .md → archive. Fallback to the objective when no recap was captured.

- `Goal.completionSummary` (extensions/goal-loop-core.ts) — persisted with the goal at
  complete_goal time, used wherever the widget/notify previously echoed the objective.
- Widget + status terminal line → `─ ✓ done · <recap> · took X` (extensions/goal-loop-display.ts).
- Detached-audit settle notify → `✓ done: <recap> — auditor <model> approved.` (was
  `Goal complete — auditor <model> approved.` — process only, no information). Tool-path
  `/goal verify` external notify: same swap to the recap. Both: captured BEFORE
  archiveCurrentGoal mutates state.goal.
- `renderGoalMarkdown` → new `## Completion summary` section so the archive carries the
  full-length recap (widget shows a truncated line; the .md has the whole thing).
- Tests: display v0.34.89 test kept as fallback (no summary → objective); new v0.34.91
  tests pin the recap-preferred + whitespace-only fallback, plus the settle-notify carries
  the recap (not process boilerplate). `revision-bound-audit` asserts the recap lands on
  the goal at claim time.

### 0.34.90 — Never spam the chat: quota-wall prompt fires ONCE per parked episode, cross-session; redundant "Auditor queued" notify removed

Field (endless-td, 2026-08-07, Screenshot_20260807_231717): the chat showed FOUR nearly identical "Provider quota wall — [TRIAGE-2026-08-06 findings.md:591] …" messages. Ledger forensics: the same parked triage goal was prompted every hour (scheduled 18:03→19:00, 19:15→20:00, 20:15→21:00 after the 18:00 send) because auto-recovery flapping re-arms the schedule each cycle, and FOUR pi sessions on the same project each scheduled their own prompt for the same :00 (09:19/09:20/09:25/09:35 → 10:00). The in-memory `quotaPromptScheduledFor` guard is per-session only; the hourly repeat was per-episode re-park; nothing was durable. User principle: "we should never spam in the chat."

- `scheduleQuotaResumePrompt` now writes `goalId`/`loopTarget` + `episodeAt` into the `quota_prompt_scheduled` ledger event and SCANS the shared ledger before scheduling: a peer session's pending schedule for the same :00 slot suppresses this session (kills the bunching), and a `quota_prompt_sent` for the same key while the loop is parked suppresses loop re-schedules.
- NEW durable once-per-episode marker on the Goal: `quotaPromptedAt` (ISO, persisted with the goal). Set when the prompt actually SENDS; while set, NO schedule is accepted — in any session — even when auto-recovery flaps (probe success → goal runs minutes → wall again). Cleared ONLY by a user resume: cmdResume's probe branch, the paused→active transition, and `manuallyResumeMainModelRecovery`. Auto-recovery success does NOT clear it (that is the flap).
- `fireQuotaResumePrompt` writes the same key fields back into `quota_prompt_sent` and marks the goal (only when the parked goal is still the one captured at schedule time).
- Removed the redundant `"Auditor queued (detached worker, model: …)"` info notify from the complete_goal path — pi's own tool response already says the claim persisted and the detached auditor is queued; the widget/status line surface `auditor: queued/running/live`. One notification per state transition.
- Tests (quota-prompter): +3 — hourly repeat is dead (flap after the one prompt schedules NOTHING), peer-session same-:00 slot suppresses (ledger scan), user resume re-arms exactly one fresh prompt. Test-order hardening: new `__testOnlyResetStallState()` (the stall-brake counters leak across files in bun's shared module registry — short no-tool "back up" turns in earlier tests tripped a bogus "stalled" decision-pause on the resumed goal, which then silently skipped the park). Suite 1093/1/0 across 100 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.89 — Terminal goals collapse to a dim one-line summary (widget + status; Screenshot_20260807_231205/231236)

Field: after a batch finishes, the widget kept rendering a full completion CARD (`✓ <objective> · ✓ complete · took 4h 38m` + `└─ auditor approved (…)`) and the status line kept a loud `glla: ✓ complete · took 4h 38m` — indefinitely, until the next goal started. The completed item read like still-active work sitting on the surface (user: "shouldn't we close complete goals or at least show them differently?").

Fix: no card, no loud claim — a single dim SUMMARY. (1) Widget: `completedGoalLines` collapses to ONE line — `─ ✓ done · <objective> · took 4h 38m` (aborted keeps `✗ aborted` + a short reason). (2) Status line: `glla: ✓ done · 4h 38m` (dim; aborted: `✗ aborted · …`). The verdict/reason stays in the archive (`.pi-glla/goals/*.md`, audits.jsonl) and `/goal status`; the widget leaves a trace ("what ran + how long") without a second active-looking surface. `completionSummary` + the now-unused `auditVerdictLabel` import removed.

Files: `extensions/goal-loop-display.ts`. Tests: `tests/display.test.ts` — 4 v0.34.65 card tests rewritten for the summary (single-line, no verdict on the widget, no fabricated verdict) + held-loop suffix test updated. Suite: 1090 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files (unchanged count — same number of tests, rewritten). tsc clean.

### 0.34.88 — No-turn-start retry: 30s first window + ONE verbatim auto-retry (closes note.md "pi did not start turn")

Field: a continuation was accepted but pi never started the turn — no turn-start proof. The v0.34.74 handling waited 150s then declared the dispatch unacknowledged, forcing a manual `/list resume` for every miss; transient misses (turn-start event lost, busy session) looked identical to a genuine provider stall.

Fix: (1) first window 150s → 30s (`CONTINUATION_START_TIMEOUT_MS`, env override unchanged); (2) exactly ONE automatic retry that re-sends the **verbatim original payload** (captured at all 4 send sites as `lastContinuationSentPayload`) and re-arms for a 60s backoff (`NO_TURN_START_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`) — transient misses self-heal, and only the second window failure (a genuine stall) reaches the explicit `/list|/goal|/loop resume` fallback. Worst case before the fallback is 90s, under the old single 150s window. Retry is gated by persisted `record.retryCount` (sidecar field, no protocol bump), guarded by goal/loop actionability + stale-API checks, and ledgered as `continuation_retry_sent` / `continuation_retry_send_failed`; a paused goal's watchdog is cleared at pause, so it is never blind-retried.

Files: `extensions/loops/goal.ts`, `extensions/goal-loop-dispatch.ts` (optional `retryCount`/`retrySentAt`). Tests: `tests/behavioral-orchestrator.test.ts` (3 watchdog tests updated for the retry + 3 new: self-heal verbatim, genuine-stall fallback, paused-never-retried), `tests/loops/goal.test.ts` (v0.34.57 tests take the backoff override; order-independence via `__testOnlyResetOwnerSession`), `tests/stall-handling.test.ts` (source pins). `audit/NO-TURN-START-RETRY-2026-08-07.md`. Suite: 1090 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files (was 1087/1/0). tsc clean.


### 0.34.87 — Status-surface separation: paused list item vs active session (closes note.md Screenshots 161659/161718)

Field: `∴ Working…` (session-level) shown alongside `list item · paused · 1h 31m` and `⏵ auditor: blocked — no verdict`; the status line claimed `glla: MAIN HOST · SUPERVISING · auditor blocked — no verdict` while the card read paused; `complete_goal` answered "No active goal." while the widget clearly held a paused item. The status bar mixed session-level activity with goal-level state — two contradictory surfaces. (pi's own Working… indicator is session-generation and stays; glla's surfaces must never claim goal activity while the item is parked.)

Fix — three surfaces: (1) status line for a paused audit-no-verdict item: `glla: MAIN HOST · SUPERVISING · auditor blocked — no verdict` → `glla: ⏸ paused · auditor parked — no verdict · /list resume` (+ ` · N queued`); a parked item is deliberately NOT host-bearing (the v0.34.57 MAIN_HOST_LABEL guard still covers auditing). (2) Widget card: `auditor: blocked — no verdict` → `auditor: parked — no verdict`; "MAIN host remains attached" → "the stored completion claim was not evaluated — the audit waits while the item is paused" — "parked" names the goal state; "blocked" read as live failure next to ⏸. (3) `complete_goal` on a paused goal: the flat "No active goal." → "No active goal — the goal is paused; /goal resume reactivates it" (list policy names /list resume).

Files: `extensions/goal-loop-display.ts` (status + card parked rendering), `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (complete_goal paused response). Tests: `tests/display.test.ts` (no-verdict test rewritten to parked semantics + list/queue variant; MAIN_HOST_LABEL guard test updated — paused is not host-bearing), `tests/mode-command-guidance.test.ts` (fallback wording), `tests/behavioral-orchestrator.test.ts` (cold-start hold pins the parked card; +1 MockPi complete_goal-on-paused test). `audit/STATUS-SURFACE-SEPARATION-2026-08-07.md`. Suite: 1087 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files (was 1085/1/0). tsc clean.

### 0.34.86 — Auditor liveness / progress signals (phase labels + report byte-counter, closes note.md Screenshots 161837/175627)

Field (queue item: auditor liveness/progress signals): the auditor's report stream is muted by default (v0.34.66 — "report stream muted — final text at verdict"), so a 5-minute audit pass shows a timer counting up with zero visible progress — a hung worker and a working-but-silent worker look identical.

Fix: intermediate progress signals, gated behind a new opt-out `auditorProgressSignals` (default on; off = exact pre-v0.34.86 look). (1) A monotonic report byte-counter: the worker counts `text_delta` chars into `reportBytes` → `progress.json` → parent `asProgress` → `latestAuditProgress` → the widget's silent mode now shows `report stream muted — 12.4 KB written · final text at verdict` instead of the dead muted line (falls back when bytes are absent). (2) Objective-vocabulary phase labels while the coarse phase is running: `thinking` → `reading source…`, `producing_report` → `writing report…` on both the status line and the card (`auditor reading source…` / `auditor: writing report…`). (3) Settings menu row + `/glla auditorProgressSignals` toggle.

Files: `scripts/goal-auditor-worker.mjs` (byte counter), `extensions/goal-loop-auditor-process.ts` (optional `reportBytes` passthrough, PROTOCOL_VERSION unchanged), `extensions/goal-loop-display.ts` (`auditorProgressPhaseLabel`, `fmtByteCount`, silent-mode counter line), `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (publish passthrough, refreshUI extras, toggle), `extensions/goal-settings.ts` + `extensions/settings-menu.ts` (setting + row). Tests: `tests/display.test.ts` +4, `tests/auditor-process.test.ts` extended (real worker → parent monotonic byte counts). `audit/AUDITOR-PROGRESS-SIGNALS-2026-08-07.md`. Suite: 1085 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files (was 1081/1/0). tsc clean.

### 0.34.85 — Subagent hang detection (no-progress watchdog, closes note.md Screenshots 161019/161032)

Field (note.md, screenshots 16:10 on 2026-08-07): subagents frozen at 10697s (3h) with 0 stream activity — repeated "BUSY with zero stream activity" warnings at 22/31/41 min. The auditor's detached worker has a heartbeat-without-progress watchdog (auditor-process.ts, 10m default); subagent sessions had NONE — a hung subagent burns parent tokens for hours before anyone notices.

Fix: a per-subagent no-progress watchdog in the main session. `subagents:started` seeds a probe (recordId/type/summary/spawn); `subagents:compacted`/`subagents:steered` refresh the streak; `subagents:completed`/`subagents:failed` end it. Each heartbeat, the scan polls the live record via the cross-package registry `Symbol.for("pi-subagents:manager")` → `getRecord(id)` — live `toolUses` (per tool activity) and `lifetimeUsage.output` (per assistant message_end) are the "new tool call or output" progress signal, joined without a cross-extension stream event. A record still "running" with no new progress for `SUBAGENT_HANG_NO_PROGRESS_MS = 5m` (SHORTER than the auditor's 10m — a hung subagent costs parent tokens every turn) gets a throttled `ui.notify` + `notifyExternal` + `subagent_hang_detected` ledger entry so the main session can decide to abort. Detection + guidance only — never an auto-kill.

Files: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (probe registry, exported pure `classifyHungSubagents`, heartbeatTick scan, probe seeding + 4 new `subagents:*` listeners, `__testOnly` hooks), `tests/subagent-hang-detection.test.ts` (11 tests: 5 pure classify + 6 integration via MockPi emitBus + heartbeat tick with a faked manager registry), `audit/SUBAGENT-HANG-DETECTION-2026-08-07.md`. Suite: 1081 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 100 files (was 1070/1/0). tsc clean.

### 0.34.84 — Hourly quota probe for the auditor retry envelope (closes note.md Screenshots 160846–161010)

Field (note.md, six screenshots 16:08–16:10 on 2026-08-07): the auditor's durable quota-retry envelope (v0.34.79) retried attempt 1 eagerly at 5s, then fell onto exponential rungs — 60m → 2h → 4h → … The auditor was observed parked at "Retrying (13/15) in 6232s–6367s" ≈ 1h44m between probes, with a separate main-thread "next probe in 32m–51m" timer running in parallel. Exponential rungs don't align with the provider's quota-reset boundary, so the goal could sit a 2h/4h rung while the quota had already reset at a top-of-hour the plugin never probed.

Fix: `auditorQuotaRetryPlan` (extensions/loops/goal.ts) now routes quota-shaped errors (error text matching the conservative `quotaSignal` patterns — `rate-limit` | `plan-quota` | `billing`) to an hour-aligned probe on attempts 2+, binding the existing `nextHourlyPromptMs` helper (goal-loop-core.ts:48): retry at the next top-of-hour strictly after now, floored at 60s. Priority stays: upstream hint > attempt-1 eager 5s > (quota → hourly | transient → exponential 2h/4h…). A stuck provider that isn't quota-shaped still gets the exponential cadence; the 5-attempt horizon and 5h cap are untouched.

### 0.34.83 — Reviewer "issue" misparse fix (closes note.md Screenshot_20260807_161539)

Field (note.md, 7 screenshots 16:08–16:18 on 2026-08-07): the reviewer's bug regex (`/\bTODO\b|\bFIXME\b|\bbug\b|\bissue\b|regression|broken|\bfixme\b/i`) matched the bare word "issue" — every completion summary that cited a GitHub issue number ("fixed in GitHub issue #5", "traced via gh-123", "this issue is open") produced a junk bug-class finding that was enqueued to `/list`. The reviewer then cascade-activated that finding as its own list item. The workaround in the last few goals was rewriting `newObjective` prose to be trigger-word-free; the fix removes the workaround's cause.

Fix: drop `\bissue\b` from the `bug` regex (real bug markers stay: `TODO`/`FIXME`/`bug`/`regression`/`broken`/`fixme`); add `GitHub issue`, `gh-N`, and `issue tracker/board/queue` to `REVIEWER_VOCAB` for defense-in-depth so a GitHub-issue citation on any line skips classification entirely.

Files: `extensions/reviewer.ts:81` (CLASS_PATTERNS regex) + `extensions/reviewer.ts:91` (REVIEWER_VOCAB GitHub-issue branch), `tests/reviewer-extraction-hardening.test.ts` (+2 tests: GitHub-issue refs and prose phrases don't classify; full `runReviewer` over a GitHub-issue-citing source produces zero bug findings). Suite: 1065 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 99 files (was 1063/1/0). Audit: triage is in note.md under "Triaged 2026-08-07"; design + history (why `\bissue\b` was added in the first place, the v0.34.82 false-positive class) in `audit/REVIEWER-ISSUE-MISPARSE-2026-08-07.md`.

### 0.34.82 — Context-starvation refuse gate (compaction-off drain guard)

Field (screenshot 2026-08-07 16:50:55, this user): user-level settings had `compaction.enabled:false`. The `agent_end` yield path correctly refused to send a 1-token length-continue (v0.34.19), but the heartbeat kept refiring full turns against the same near-full context — the session drained from 98% to 120% over six retries, every retry was a 1-token truncation, and the only `session_compact` event landed after the user manually triggered a restart. The "stalled session" was actually the plugin's own heartbeat refire against an uncompacted context.

Fix: track consecutive `length_continue_deferred_context_full` events with a 90s window. When the streak reaches 2 with no `session_compact` since, the heartbeat stops scheduling new continuations and posts a one-shot warning: *"auto-compaction appears to be off (or not running) — context is starving and the next turn would just truncate again. Run `/compact` once, or set `compaction.enabled:true` in ~/.pi/agent/settings.json to let pi handle this automatically."* The streak is cleared by the next `session_compact` event, so the heartbeat resumes its normal refire once compaction lands. This makes a disabled-compaction config a loud, scoped failure instead of a silent drain; it does not change the yield path itself (no premature sends even in the disabled state).

Separately: flipped the user-level `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` `compaction.enabled` back to `true` and `reserveTokens` to pi's default 16 384 (was `100 000`, which made auto-compaction only kick in when the session was already critically full). `globalContextLimit:200000` and the rest of the file are untouched.

Files: `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (v0.34.82 helpers + heartbeat gate + yield-path ledger update), `tests/stall-handling.test.ts` (+1 regression). Suite: 1062 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 99 files. Audit: `audit/CONTEXT-STARVATION-REFUSE-2026-08-07.md`.

**Audit-followup (closes GitHub #4 audit 2026-08-07T15:39:15):** the auto-audit (audit-msizvzvc) flagged two narrow issues, both fixed:
- `tests/list-subtasks.test.ts:29` imported `bun:test` without type declarations → `npx tsc --noEmit` exited 2. Changed to `node:test` to match the project convention (every other test file uses it). `tsc --noEmit` now exits 0.
- The custom-path test only asserted `__testOnlyLastConfirmDialog` (assigned *before* the factory runs); the mock invoked the factory but discarded the returned component, so swapping the component or throwing from its constructor would still pass. New test (`tests/confirm-draft.test.ts` "v0.34.82: the custom-path factory is INVOKED and returns a ConfirmDraftComponent") captures the factory's RETURNED object and asserts `instanceof ConfirmDraftComponent` plus the rendered output contains the Markdown body and all three choices.

Suite now 1063 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 99 files.

### 0.34.81 — LIGHT parent/child for list items (Subtask of: …)

A `/list add` declaration may now begin with `Subtask of: <parent objective> — <child objective>` to bind the item as a child of a parent queue item. The marker is line-start, case-insensitive, consumed before the `Parallel:` / `Done when:` passes; the child objective carries its own clauses normally. Resolution is by `normalizeObjective` match — earlier items in the same batch win, then the existing queue — with three refused-badly cases (empty child, unresolved parent, nested). A group (a queue item with one or more open children) is not a work item: the auto-advance silently skips it and lands on its first open child; an EXPLICIT pick (`/list next <n>`, `list_activate`) on a group refuses loudly so the user is not confused by a silent jump. When the last child completes, `archiveCurrentGoal` removes the parent from the queue, deletes its disk sidecar, and ledger-records `list_group_closed` — no synthetic goal archive md (the child IS the audit unit). `/list show` and `list_status` render parents as `N. <objective> [group: N open]` with children as `N.1`, `N.2` indented underneath. One level only — nesting is refused at enqueue. Full sub-goal tree (focus/unfocus, per-subtree audit) remains parked. Audit: `audit/LIST-SUBTASKS-2026-08-07.md`. Tests: `tests/list-subtasks.test.ts` (+16, total now 1061 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 99 files).

## 0.34.80 — 2026-08-07

### 0.34.80 — stuck "auditing" freeze: stale-latch verdict drop + RPC-stub confirm rework (2026-08-07)

Field incident (the "are we stuck" freeze): a latched-stale LIVE session
froze the queue at item 2 for 30m+ with zero ledger activity while the
detached auditor's DISAPPROVED verdict sat complete on disk.

- **Fix A — the apply gate never drops a completed verdict silently**: when
  `freshCtxForGeneration` nulls out on a latched-stale session (transient
  heartbeat-probe failures tripping goStaleTerminal — the session was
  alive), the verdict is deferred durably: `audit_verdict_deferred` ledger
  + `markCompletionAuditRecoveryPending(lastCtx, "verdict-apply-gate")` so
  a fresh session's recovery path surfaces it for /goal resume. The
  legit-supersede case (newer attempt owns the claim) stays silent.
- **Fix B — heartbeatTick parks a stuck auditing goal BEFORE the stale
  latch's early return**: the stranded-audit recovery was unreachable below
  the `extensionApiStale` branch; a stale-latch variant now runs first via
  the kept last context (`stranded_audit_recovered` `via: "stale-latch"`),
  guarded by the exact stuck signature (auditing, no in-flight, claim,
  90s silence). A heartbeat still never launches another worker.
- **GitHub #4 rework (the disapproval)**: real pi 0.84.1's `custom` is a
  function in EVERY mode (RPC/noOp resolve `undefined` without invoking the
  factory), so `typeof custom === "function"` never fired the headless
  fallback — RPC drafts were silently rejected. `confirmDraft` (and the
  copied `promptSettingsMenu` pattern) now detect availability by whether
  the builder RAN: a settled stub falls through to the byte-identical
  select host-dialog path (ledgered `confirm_dialog_fallback_select` /
  `settings_menu_fallback_select` via custom-stub). The mock harness
  emulates real interactive pi (factory invoked) and gains
  `customStubMode=true` for the exact RPC stub shape.
- Tests: tests/stuck-audit-latch.test.ts (3, new); tests/confirm-draft
  .test.ts +2 real-RPC-stub tests (fallback fires on the stub, Yes/No/
  stale); audit docs STUCK-AUDITING-LATCH-2026-08-07.md + CONFIRM-DRAFT

## 0.34.79 — 2026-08-07

The first release since v0.34.57 consolidates the unreleased milestone work
(v0.34.58–v0.34.79) into one published version; no intermediate version was
ever tagged or published. Section labels below match the in-repo milestone
markers (test-file headers, audit docs).

### 0.34.79 — eager auditor retry on infra failures (note.md 112555)

"we are not retrying the auditor as eagerly as the main thread" — measured:
`runWithInfraRetry` retries the main thread after 5s, but the auditor's
first probe was `quotaRetryDelaySeconds(1, 60)` = an hour (unless the
provider gave a Retry-After hint). A quota that expired mid-audit parked
the goal for 60m before the first retry.

- **Eager first probe**: `EAGER_AUDITOR_RETRY_SEC = 5` — the first no-hint
  attempt now retries in 5s, mirroring the main thread's backoff; provider
  hints still win; later attempts keep the exponential rungs (2h, 4h, …)
  and the bounded 5-attempt / 24h-horizon envelope is unchanged (the eager
  probe counts as attempt 1 — no 5s hammering of a stuck provider).
- **Seconds-aware wording**: both dispatch sites' pause reason / suggested
  action / notify / tool result use `fmtRetryDelay` ("5s" under a minute,
  else "60m") instead of a rounded minute.
- **`auditorQuotaRetryPlan` exported** (pure) — the schedule is unit-pinned.
- Tests: tests/auditor-eager-retry.test.ts (6, new) — eager 5s first
  attempt, exponential later rungs, upstream-hint priority, horizon bound,
  streak accounting, source pins. Full suite 1040 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail
  across 97 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.78 — draft confirm renders markdown (GitHub #4)

The draft-class confirm dialog (`confirmDraft`) rendered through plain-text
`ctx.ui.select` — no markdown, no wrapping — while the README promises
markdown-rendered confirm dialogs. `ask_user_question` is an agent tool and
can't be called from a dialog, so the confirm now hosts a real TUI component
via `ctx.ui.custom`.

- **extensions/confirm-draft.ts (new)**: `ConfirmDraftComponent` —
  DynamicBorder frame, Markdown body (title as H1, objective + contract at
  full width), a SelectList with the same three choices (Yes / Yes-and-
  always / No), and a help line. MarkdownTheme is built from the runtime
  theme's own md* colors so the dialog follows the active theme.
- **confirmDraft (goal.ts)**: custom-first when `ctx.ui.custom` exists;
  the plain select path stays as the headless/RPC fallback. The ALWAYS
  escape hatch, project autoAcceptDrafts persistence, the ledger entry,
  and the stale-API "stale" semantics are shared by both paths.
- Tests: tests/confirm-draft.test.ts (8, new) — pure markdown builder,
  component renders title/body/all three choices, first-choice
  preselection + no-throw input, custom path Yes/No/stale with dialog
  capture, select fallback Yes/stale. 3 behavioral tests converted to
  drive the dialog via customImpl. Full suite 1034 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail
  across 96 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.77 — regression shield handles non-ASCII (Chinese) contract items (GitHub #5)

The shield's token extraction regex was ASCII-only
(`split(/[^A-Za-z0-9_.\-/]+/)`), so pure-CJK contract lines produced zero
candidates and an English-written auditor report never contained the
Chinese item verbatim — 18 rounds of approved=True verdicts with
shield=False, the goal stuck active forever.

- **Unicode-aware matching** in goal-loop-shield.ts: token split and
  stripEdgePunct now use `\p{L}\p{N}` with the /u flag (a pure-Chinese
  line is ONE candidate token); tokenPresent gets an explicit Han branch
  (exact substring only — no compound-segment decomposition for Chinese
  words); the no-candidate fallback strips punctuation edges so a quote
  that drops the item's trailing full-width colon (章节： → 章节) still
  matches.
- **Prompt reinforcement** in goal-loop-auditor.ts: the REGRESSION SHIELD
  block now requires each item to be quoted VERBATIM in the contract's
  original language — a translated/paraphrased item cannot be matched and
  the approval is rejected. The shield itself stays strict (English
  paraphrase of a Chinese item still fails; no blanket leniency).
- Tests: tests/regression-shield.test.ts +6 — verbatim CJK quote passes,
  quote-without-trailing-colon passes, pure-CJK line = one candidate,
  English paraphrase still rejected, mixed item matches on its ASCII
  token, ASCII distinctive-token + compound behavior unchanged. Full
  suite 1026 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 95 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.76 — /list parallel-execution metadata (OPEN-ISSUES 1.11)

The "list with subtasks vs goal with subgoals" shape question
(Screenshot_20260805_095413): the smaller default — a `parallelSafe`
DECLARATION on /list items, with a design doc recording why the sub-goal
tree (option A) stays parked for v0.29+.

- **Schema**: `ListItem.parallelSafe?: boolean`. `Parallel: yes|no` clause
  (line-start or inline, yes/true/1/safe/parallel vs no/false/0/none/off),
  consumed from the item text — never part of the objective or contract.
  `extractParallelFlag` + `parseListItemDeclaration` (marker stripped
  BEFORE the `Done when:` split) in goal-loop-core.
- **One enqueue path** (enqueueItems + the list-draft confirm) parses the
  declaration; the disk sidecar round-trips it (survives /reload and the
  disk-first fallback). Status surfaces: `/list show` and the `list_status`
  tool render `[parallel]` on declared items.
- **Execution is unchanged** — the queue still runs serially. The flag is
  data for a future parallel dispatcher; the design doc records the
  decision table (tree vs metadata) and why option A stays parked.
- Tests: tests/list-parallel.test.ts (10) — marker parse pins
  (truthy/falsy/absent/inline), parse-order vs contract, disk round-trip
  (incl. legacy sidecars), behavioral list_add → state + sidecar + status
  tag, and activation carries the clean objective (no marker leak). Full
  suite 1020 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 95 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.75 — host-session-lost: classified session_handle_invalidated reason + pi-side finding

"host session lost" is note.md's most recurring theme (13 screenshots
08-05→08-07). Ledger sweep (all ~/Dev/**/.pi-glla/active.jsonl, 08-05→08-08):
515 session_shutdown / 522 session_rebound pairs (healthy cycles) vs 164
extension_api_stale and 23 session_handle_invalidated (ALL on 08-07, ALL
reason "unknown" pre-fix). Host-wide bursts align with session cycles; the
real losses are the single-project silent deaths (deathrun 08-07T01:02:54 —
invalidated with NO shutdown in its own ledger). The 08-05 11h orphan and
the hegemon ~5h "handing off to a fresh pi context" hang are the worst
field cases.

- **Diagnostics change**: `session_handle_invalidated` now carries a reason
  CLASSIFIED at emission via the exported
  `classifySessionHandleInvalidation` — `session_shutdown` (lifecycle
  shutdown recorded; in practice the shutdown also nulls lastCtx so the
  terminal cannot fire — this branch guards the send-path race),
  `provider_disconnect` (main model in provider-failure recovery),
  `silent_handle_death` (neither — pi invalidated the handle WITHOUT a
  replacement session: the only class that emits in practice).
- **Verified discriminator**: a proper session_shutdown suppresses the
  terminal entirely (clearSessionOwnedTimers nulls lastCtx; the loop trusts
  the announced replacement; the next session_start consumes the handoff
  debt) — no loss event. The terminal event fires only for genuine losses.
- **Pi-side finding filed** (audit/HOST-SESSION-LOST-2026-08-07.md +
  note.md cross-ref): pi must deliver a replacement session_start OR a
  session_shutdown lifecycle event when invalidating an extension handle;
  compaction paths that leave the handle stale must still emit a session
  boundary; host-wide invalidations must not leave a subset of sessions
  orphaned.
- Tests: tests/host-session-lost.test.ts (5) — classifier pins (+priority);
  behavioral silent-death (invalidateHostSession + heartbeat tick →
  reason silent_handle_death); behavioral shutdown-suppression (proper
  shutdown → NO loss event, shutdown recorded); source pins (emission uses
  the classifier; hardcoded unknown gone). New test-only hook
  __testOnlySetSessionReplacementUntil (grace-window backdate). Updated the
  v0.34.57 pin in behavioral-orchestrator to the classified reason. Full
  suite 1010 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 94 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.74 — interrupt-didn't-continue: spurious stale-revision refusal + auditing dead end

Field incident (Screenshot_20260807_100610, junk-runner): "interrupt didn't
continue". Ledger-verified chain for goal 20260806215307-4irtlm: user quit
mid-audit (01:44) → recovery dispatched a fresh audit (01:44:08) → verdict
REFUSED as stale (01:47:25) even though the goal's revision was NEVER set
(undefined) and the auditor captured 0 — the warning literally read
"revision is 0 but the auditor captured 0" — → the refusal cleared the claim
but left status `auditing`, so the re-scheduled continuation was silently
silenced by isActionableGoal() (requires active) → 90s later the heartbeat
stranded-audit recovery parked the goal paused/blocked "completion audit
interrupted — no verdict" → 7h33m of silence until a manual /list resume.

- **Fix A**: the v0.34.61 focus-revision guard (retryStoredCompletionAudit)
  now uses the canonical normalized `isGoalRevisionCurrent` instead of raw
  `state.goal.revision !== result.goalRevision.revision` — a never-set
  revision (undefined) normalizes to 0 on both sides, so a captured 0 is
  CURRENT and the verdict applies. Genuine contract moves (3 vs 4, undefined
  vs 4) still refuse.
- **Fix B**: the refusal branch now restores `status: "active"` alongside
  clearing the claim (the v0.34.59 comment said "leave the goal active" but
  the code never flipped the status), so the re-scheduled continuation
  actually sends and the loop keeps driving the current objective. Genuine
  orphans still hit the stranded-audit backstop — that path is unchanged.
- **Docs**: audit/INTERRUPT-DIDNT-CONTINUE-2026-08-07.md — the full ledger
  timeline, the root-cause chain, both fixes, evidence.
- Tests: tests/interrupt-didnt-continue.test.ts (6) — the incident case
  (undefined revision + captured 0 → current); bumped revisions still
  refuse; equal non-zero revisions stay current; source pins for Fix A
  (guard uses isGoalRevisionCurrent) and Fix B (refusal sets active +
  re-schedules); behavior-preservation pin for genuine orphans. Full suite
  1005 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 93 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.73 — id_invalidation ledger event (OPEN-ISSUES 1.12)

The invalidated-id incident (Screenshot_20260805_121634): pi invalidated the
session's extension handle without delivering a replacement — and the OLD
session id was never recorded, so the old/new pair was unrecoverable from
history. Repro'd from real ledgers (10 stale events in ai-auto-writer
2026-07-27..08-05 incl. the screenshot day, 21+ in dracon-platform — each
`extension_api_stale` orphaned until a later user action). Now the pair is
recorded on the next forced rewrite/handoff.

- **New ledger event `id_invalidation`**: `{ oldId, newId, reason, at,
  shutdownReason? (clean shutdown only), goalId? (active-goal correlation)
  }` — emitted at session_start rebind when the owner sidecar's previous
  session id differs from the fresh session's id, and at successor
  absorption (silent swap, `reason: "successor_absorption"`).
- **Reason enum** (`classifyIdInvalidationReason`, exported):
  `stale_terminal` | `zombie_stood_down` | `rebind_without_shutdown` |
  `session_shutdown` | `forced_rewrite` (new process took over with NO
  shutdown record — the crash/kill/orphan case) | `session_handoff`.
- **Fail closed**: both ids must be real and differ — a plain /reload keeps
  the same session id and emits nothing; `unknown-session` (no
  getSessionId) is never recorded; first boot (no sidecar) emits nothing.
  The audit trail now reconstructs from disk: old ledger `extension_api_stale`
  / `session_handle_invalidated` → new ledger `id_invalidation` with the pair.
- **Docs**: `audit/ID-INVALIDATION-2026-08-07.md` — repro attempt (real
  event timelines, the 2026-08-05T17:41 stale event, the 11h orphan gap,
  the missing-data finding), the fix, the reason semantics. The mmx vision
  CLI (v0.34.72 routing) read the screenshot.
- Tests: `tests/id-invalidation.test.ts` (7) — reason classifier pins;
  forced-rewrite repro (foreign-pid sidecar, no shutdown record →
  `forced_rewrite` + goalId); clean shutdown → `session_shutdown` + raw
  reason; same-id reload → none; first boot → none; absorption source pin;
  unknown-session fail-closed. Full suite 999 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across
  92 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.72 — vision-assist: see with mmx, not a model switch (note.md 2026-08-07)

The agent was too eager to switch to expensive models when it couldn't see.
Vision checks now route to the mmx vision CLI instead; model switches stay
preapproved-only (the existing forbiddenModels gate).

- **Setting `visionAssist` (default ON)**: `/glla` → Keep-going → Vision
  assist (or `/glla visionAssist=off`). On → continuation prompts carry the
  `## VISION-ASSIST — SEE WITH MMX, NOT A MODEL SWITCH` directive; off →
  no vision guidance injected (the forbiddenModels gate always stands).
- **New module `extensions/vision-assist.ts` (pure helpers)**: the
  `VISION_ASSIST_GUIDANCE` block (single source of truth), the exact
  `visionDescribeCommand(imagePath, question?)` builder (`mmx vision
  describe --image … --prompt … --quiet --non-interactive`), the routing
  rule `routeVisionCheck()` — a vision check routes to mmx vision by
  default; a FORBIDDEN target model forces the mmx-vision route and
  reports `blockedSwitch` (the preapproval gate fires); a preapproved
  target may switch; `visionAssistLedger()` builds the audit payload.
- **Ledger `vision_assist`**: when a forbidden switch is observed at
  runtime (the too-eager-switch symptom) and vision assist is on,
  `observeModelChange` also records `{ route: "mmx-vision", blockedSwitch,
  reason: "forbidden_model_switch" }` — advisory, alongside the existing
  `forbidden_model_switch` violation. Off → no vision entry.
- **Docs**: `docs/VISION-ASSIST.md` documents the policy, the exact
  command, the preapproval gate, the setting, and the implementation map
  (mmx vision verified working 2026-08-07, `status_code: 0`).
- Tests: `tests/vision-assist.test.ts` (12) — guidance block carries the
  command + preapproval rule; the doc documents both; command builder;
  router (forbidden → mmx+blockedSwitch, preapproved → allowed, no target
  → mmx); the gate itself (isForbiddenModel + DEFAULT_FORBIDDEN_MODELS);
  continuation carries the directive by default and drops it when off;
  runtime forbidden switch records vision_assist (and not when off). Full
  suite 992 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 91 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.71 — subagent_session ledger on Agent-tool spawn (OPEN-ISSUES 1.16)

"Subagents lost between restarts": parents could not recover subagent
references after a /reload because the Agent-tool registry is in-process
and dies with the session. Each Agent-tool spawn is now ledgered on disk
with the session id + summary, so the reference survives.

- **Spawn hook**: pi-subagents broadcasts a cross-extension lifecycle
  event on `pi.events` (`subagents:started`, payload `{ id, type,
  description }`) when an Agent-tool subagent transitions to running —
  once per spawn, foreground AND background, queued and resumed agents
  included. The extension subscribes in activate() (goal.ts, end of the
  listener block) and appends `subagent_session` to the ledger
  (`.pi-glla/active.jsonl` — on disk, restart-proof).
- **Entry shape**: `{ sessionId, agentType, summary, goalId, at }` —
  summary is the Agent-tool `description` (the 3-5 word task label the
  parent matches on); goalId correlates the spawn to the active goal.
  Re-observation of an id (resume/re-run) appends again — fresh evidence
  the reference is alive.
- **Guards**: the handler drops spawns observed before any session bound
  a ctx (freshCtx() null — a fresh process at boot has no session yet),
  is gated on the same handoff/stale/zombie flags as every other
  listener, and silently ignores malformed payloads (missing/empty id,
  non-object data).
- **Mock**: MockPi now exposes the `events` EventBus on its api (emit/on)
  plus an `emitBus(channel, data)` helper so tests can fire pi-subagents
  lifecycle broadcasts.
- Tests: `tests/subagent-session-ledger.test.ts` (5) — orphan spawn
  before any session writes nothing; a spawn appends id + summary + goal
  correlation; the reference SURVIVES a /reload (restart-recovery) and
  post-restart spawns still append; every spawn observation appends
  (resume re-ledgers); malformed payloads are dropped. Full suite 980
  pass / 1 skip / 0 fail across 90 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.70 — impossible /list items auto-drop instead of stopping (note.md 2026-08-07)

"auto drop impossible ones i think or auto adjust instead of stopping" —
an agent-authored blocked pause that offers NO way forward no longer stops
the /list queue: the item is dropped (ledgered) and the queue advances.

- **Defined impossible state** (pause_goal handler, goal.ts): a /list item
  paused as `kind="blocked"` with no non-empty `suggestedAction` — the
  pause itself declares "blocked forever, no resume path". Every internal
  blocked pause (restore hold, audit retry horizon, abort wall, …)
  carries a suggestedAction, so only an agent-authored blocked pause that
  offers no way forward reaches the rule; a blocked pause WITH a resume
  path is never overridden, and plain goals are never list-dropped.
- **Behavior**: detection ledgered as `list_item_impossible` (itemId,
  reason, objective) + drop ledgered as `list_item_auto_dropped`
  (reason "blocked with no resume path"); the queue then auto-advances
  (`activateNextListItem`) when items remain and no loop owns the surface
  (one-active-thing choke point). Last item → list goes empty with a
  pointer to /list add. Warning notify + the pause tool's returned text
  tell the agent the item was dropped and the list moved on.
- Tests: `tests/impossible-list-drop.test.ts` (5) — the rule (drop
  ledgered both ways + advance, still-active next item); the resume-path
  guard (blocked WITH suggestedAction stays paused, queue untouched); the
  plain-goal guard (no list ledger); last-item (drop ledgered, empty-list
  notify, no advance); loop hold (drop ledgered, no advance over a live
  loop, follow-up stays queued). Full suite 975 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail
  across 89 files, tsc clean.

### 0.34.69 — bare tweak launches the update-proposal flow (note.md 2026-08-07)

"list tweak seems too literal, doesnt work, it should launcher into a what
we update into" — a bare `/list tweak` (and `/goal tweak`) previously died
with a "Usage:" notify. Both now LAUNCH the flow: the current item text is
surfaced (notify preview + input pre-fill), the replacement is collected
interactively, and the old→new proposal is confirmed BEFORE any apply.

- `cmdTweak` (goal.ts): a bare tweak notifies the current text, then
  `ctx.ui.input` (pre-filled with the current objective — "what should we
  update the list item/goal into?") collects the replacement; empty/cancel
  → "Tweak cancelled; nothing changed."; otherwise the existing
  CURRENT/NEW confirm gates the apply. The no-objective edge (a bare
  "Done when: …" input) gets a plain message instead of a Usage line.
- **No-op guard**: a replacement identical to the current objective with no
  contract change now cancels instead of bumping the v0.34.61 revision
  (which would have invalidated the last auditor approval for a tweak that
  changed NOTHING — reachable by a plain Enter on the pre-fill).
- Tests: `tests/list-tweak-proposal.test.ts` (5) — bare /list tweak
  launches the flow (current-text preview + pre-fill, CURRENT/NEW confirm,
  applied via "/list tweak", still paused, revision bumped once); empty
  input cancels with no confirm; unchanged text is a no-op with no revision
  bump; interactive "Done when:" clause applies the contract; bare /goal
  tweak mirrors the flow. Full suite 970 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail, tsc
  clean.

### 0.34.68 — list/goal mode-gate self-heal (bug 1.7)

OPEN-ISSUES 1.7 (Screenshot_20260804_212233): after some draft workflow,
`/list` and `/goal` started silently refusing actions until a restart.
`readState` trusts the active.jsonl `state` event verbatim, so a parse
failure could leave `state.goal.policy` outside {goal,list}; every mode
gate branching on `state.goal.policy === "list"` then refused the wrong
surface until a restart rebuilt clean state.

- **core** (`goal-loop-core.ts`): `parseGoalPolicyFromMd` re-parses the
  durable `**Policy**: …` marker from the active-goal .md;
  `healCorruptedGoalPolicy(state, cwd)` repairs a corrupted in-memory
  policy in place from that source, ledgering `goal_policy_healed`
  (and `goal_policy_heal_failed` when no durable source exists — no
  invented mode).
- **gates** (`goal.ts`): `healGoalPolicy(ctx)` runs at the top of
  `cmdGoal` and `cmdList` (before any policy gate) and at session_start
  right after `readState` — before the restore gate can rewrite the
  durable .md with the corrupted value. Silent rejection replaced by a
  visible "Recovered the goal mode … no restart needed" notify.
- Tests: `tests/policy-self-heal.test.ts` — pure parse/heal pins
  (heal / healthy-noop / no-source-failure / readState round-trip) and
  the bug 1.7 regression: corrupted in-memory policy + durable .md →
  the gate heals and proceeds (no refusal, no restart). Full suite
  965 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail, tsc clean.

### 0.34.67 — worker/subagent text paragraphs get breathing room

note.md 08-06 (Screenshot_20260806_223836): "visually subagents least need
more spacing for text". The auditing card's worker-text paragraph
(`tool:`, `latest:`, `unmatched tool events:` observations) sat flush
against the footer verdict line. A new styling constant,
`WORKER_TEXT_SPACER` (a dim `│ ·` hairline), is inserted between the
observations paragraph and the card footer. pi-tui skips whitespace-only
widget lines (Text.render returns [] when trim is empty), so the spacer
carries the dim hairline rather than a truly empty line — it reads as
whitespace but renders a visible row.

- display: `WORKER_TEXT_SPACER` styling constant; the auditing block
  pushes it after the observations paragraph when observations exist.
- tests: display.test.ts pins the constant value and its position between
  the observation text and the footer, plus a negative pin (no spacer
  when there is no worker text). Full suite 958 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail,
  tsc clean.

### 0.34.66 — auditor stream is final-only by default

note.md #4 (Screenshot_20260804_211341/211506): the HUD rendered the
detached auditor's report assembling "words one by one" as the worker
streamed. The display now has a `auditorSilent` toggle (default ON)
gating the per-token tail: while the worker streams, the widget shows a
`report stream muted — final text at verdict` note; the text surfaces
only at the verdict, when the report is FINAL. `off` restores the live
tail.

- **display path**: `WidgetExtras.auditorSilent` (undefined → silent)
  gates the widget's `latest:` observation in the auditing card; the
  status line (phase + tool + activity, no streamed text) is unchanged.
- **settings**: `auditorSilent?: boolean`, default `true` in
  DEFAULT_SETTINGS, in SETTINGS_KEYS for provenance.
- **/glla menu**: new "Silent auditor stream" row in the auditor section
  (on/off) with a dispatcher case in handleSettingChoice.
- **orchestrator**: refreshUI passes the effective toggle into widget
  extras from loadSettings.
- Tests: display.test.ts — silent-default pin (no live tail + muted
  note), final-report-at-verdict, `auditorSilent: false` live-tail
  variant (2 new, 1 updated); settings-menu-complete coverage list
  includes auditorSilent. Full suite 956 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail, tsc
  clean.

### 0.34.65 — completed goals show outcome, duration, and final verdict

note.md 2026-08-07 (Screenshot_20260807_093742): "lets show how long ago
the goal/list/loop started and if ended how long it took and possibly at
the end we can show more info … this seems weak for a complete goal."
Started/elapsed was already on the active goal card and loop card; the gap
was the END: the widget and status line went empty the moment a goal
completed, so a finished batch (empty list) left no trace of what ran or
how long it took.

- **Terminal-goal widget card.** A completed/aborted goal now renders a
  card (`✓ complete · took 1h 45m` / `✗ aborted`) instead of vanishing;
  the head carries the objective + wall duration (updatedAt − createdAt),
  and a `└─` line adds the final stored verdict — `auditor approved
  (model)` from the same `auditVerdictLabel` classification, or the abort
  reason — or honestly says `archived · no stored verdict` when the goal
  was archived without one.
- **Status line names the outcome.** `glla: ✓ complete · took X` (or
  `✗ aborted · took X`) replaces the empty segment; a held loop still
  rides as the ` · loop⏸held` suffix and keeps its own card when no goal
  exists.
- Tests: `tests/display.test.ts` — duration + verdict card, abort reason
  card, no-verdict honesty, status-line outcome (2 updated, 3 new pins).

### 0.34.64 — QUOTA WALL display removed; blocked pauses auto-clear on recovery

User report (dracon-platform/web 2026-08-07): woke up to a parked goal
whose card said "QUOTA WALL · automatic retries stopped · manual resume
required" — even though the quota had ALREADY recovered at 05:07Z. The
card lied twice: `isQuotaWall()` regex matched the word "quota" in the
agent's own past-tense narration ("Quota recovered, but the two contract
blockers…"), and the pause the goal was actually parked on (kind="blocked")
was not auto-cleared when mainModelRecovery went set → null.

Direction from the user: "we dont want a quota wall at all, we are just
retrying a lot and retry after every starts of an hour" + "manual resume
is the exact wrong idea — we want to keep going".

- **QUOTA WALL display concept removed.** The dedicated wall banner, the
  "manual resume required" wording, and the `isQuotaWall` /
  `quotaWallDetail` / `quotaResumeText` render helpers are gone. Every
  retry-class pause (wait or blocked with a recovery timer) renders the
  same uniform line: `auto-retrying · next probe in X` — quota, billing,
  429, transient, whatever. The durable reason still lives in state and
  the ledger for forensics; the card no longer claims a wall exists.
- **Blocked pauses auto-clear when the underlying condition resolves.**
  `mainModelRecoverySucceeded` now accepts pauseKind="blocked" (previously
  only "wait") when the pauseReason matches a quota-style indicator
  (main model recovery / quota / rate limit / Token Plan / insufficient /
  credits / billing prefixes). autoResume:true honors "keep going" — a
  blocked pause authored in response to the wall is un-parked and
  re-engaged once the wall is gone. Decision/error pauses (intentional
  user action) are still never auto-cleared, and a blocked pause with a
  NON-quota reason stays blocked.
- **Manual-resume nudges removed from the card.** The "resumes X — or
  /goal resume now" countdown line is gone (the auto-retrying line owns
  the wait); the sidebar badge reads `⏳ auto-retrying · auto-retry in X`
  for waits and `⏸ action needed` for blocked-without-timer.
- Tests: `tests/blocked-pause-autoclear.test.ts` (4 — blocked+quota
  auto-clears; blocked+non-quota stays; wait+quota regression guard;
  source guard); display tests rewritten to pin the uniform auto-retrying
  card (no QUOTA WALL anywhere); source-guard regexes updated
  (uniform-provider-retry, mode-command-guidance, stall-handling).

### 0.34.63 — hour-aligned recovery probes; dead-countdown restart fix

Field: dracon-platform/web 2026-08-07 — a 429 wall parked the list item
into durable recovery (retryAt 01:33, attempts 1); the user quit pi and
resumed; the resumed session arrived with a NEW SessionManager object, the
foreign-session gate silently DROPPED it (no `session_rebound`, no restore),
and the wall card kept a dead countdown — the probe at 01:33 never ran and
the item stayed parked until a manual `/list resume`.

- **Barrier-completing resume accepted** (session_start gate): while THIS
  process is waiting on the load barrier (`initialSessionLoadPending` set
  by a blank startup), a lifecycle start (`resume`/`new`/`fork`/`reload`)
  from the same workspace carrying the SAME session identity (`getSessionId`
  equality via `sameSessionIdentity`) IS that load completing — accepted
  before the foreign gate. Different session ids stay refused; in-memory
  workers (no session id) fail closed.
- **Hour-aligned probes** (`hourAlignedRetryDelayMs`): the failure-driven
  recovery envelope now probes at the next :00 of the LOCAL clock hour
  (quota windows reset on the hour — the 15m/30m/1h ladder from the wall
  time probed mid-hour every time). Kind-independent (v0.34.51 uniform
  envelope preserved: a 503 waits the same boundary as a 429); upstream
  Retry-After hints still outrank the alignment when within the 5h probe
  budget; the attempt counter no longer shapes the delay. The ladder
  survives only as the no-model-ref fallback (mainModelRetryMinutes knob).
- **Wall wording**: the card's countdown line now reads `auto-retrying ·
  next probe in …` instead of `waiting — nothing for you to do` (the
  system IS probing; the old line mis-sold the wait).
- Tests: `tests/recovery-restore-after-restart.test.ts` (3 — incident
  reproduction: quit → blank startup → same-id resume restores the probe
  and it fires; different-id lifecycle start refused; source guard);
  hour-aligned unit pins in `main-model-recovery.test.ts` and
  `uniform-provider-retry.test.ts` (hint override + over-budget hint
  fallback + exact :00 boundary math); display pin updated.

### 0.34.62 — spurious-stale self-heal; heartbeat probe debounce

Field: hegemon 2026-08-06 — ONE heartbeat probe failure latched
`extensionApiStale` and parked the goal plane ("this session is handing off
 to a fresh pi context — /list will be handled after session_start") for
 ~5 hours while the SAME pi process kept serving commands. pi never
 replaced the session (compaction emits only `session_compact` — no
 `session_shutdown`, no `session_start`), so no rebind ever arrived and the
 only recovery was a restart.

- **Heartbeat probe debounce** (`HEARTBEAT_STALE_DEBOUNCE = 3`): the
  heartbeat now counts consecutive RAW probe failures and only declares the
  stale terminal at the debounce threshold — a single transient probe
  failure (pi mid-settle, compaction settle, provider pause) must not park
  a live session. The non-caching `probeExtensionApiStaleRaw()` was
  extracted for this; the cached probe keeps its semantics elsewhere.
- **Same-session self-heal** (`selfHealStaleSameSession`, wired at the top
  of `rememberCtx` before successor absorption): when a user command
  arrives from the SAME sessionManager after the park, the rebind grace has
  expired, the owner file shows no successor instance, and the fresh probe
  is healthy, the park was wrong — the plane is reclaimed (ledger
  `stale_self_healed`), and the interrupted goal resumes per the
  autoResume gate (hold-everything keeps the interrupt marker and asks for
  an explicit resume; loops stay held). Refused for zombies, foreign
  sessions (absorption owns that path), inside the rebind window, and for
  genuinely-dead handles.
- Tests: `tests/stale-self-heal.test.ts` (7 — debounce, heal, dead-handle
  refusal, foreign refusal, rebind-window refusal, loop-held pin,
  source guards); `__testOnlyHeartbeatTick` keeps its single-tick terminal
  contract via a debounce override; new `__testOnlyHeartbeatTickRaw` /
  `__testOnlySetHeartbeatStaleDebounce` hooks.

### Changed — provider-failure retry is uniformly kind-independent

- The last quota-only parking gate is gone: an upstream reset hint beyond the
  five-hour probe budget no longer parks the goal on a manual hold — the
  bounded durable envelope owns the wait, and only the kind-independent 24h
  horizon ends automatic probes.
- Removed the quota-gated `mainModelHintExceedsProbeBudget` hold path from
  `extensions/loops/goal.ts` (the billing manual-hold was already gone since
  v0.34.51); the auditor durable branch keeps catching any non-timeout
  infrastructure error with neutral `auditor retry:` wording.

## 0.34.57 — 2026-08-05

The first release since v0.34.50 consolidates the unreleased milestone work
(v0.34.51–v0.34.57) into one published version; no intermediate version was
ever tagged or published. Section labels below match the in-repo milestone
markers (test-file headers, DESIGN.md addenda).

### 0.34.51 — uniform provider-failure envelope; /list stale-context honesty; contract-text semantics; mode-aware guidance

- **One retry envelope, bounded** (the "dumb retry" policy): error text is NOT trusted to pick a retry policy. Every main-model failure — quota, billing/credits, auth, transient, unknown — rides the same durable envelope `15m → 30m → 1h → 2h → 4h → 5h` (probe cap 5h, automatic window 24h, then explicit resume starts a fresh window). The billing-hold special case is removed (`main_model_billing_hold` is legacy); classification only labels the card/badge and preserves the raw provider message in durable state and the ledger. The only failures that never auto-retry are those identified by positive evidence as futile: context/output-token limits and user aborts (`non-recoverable`), plus auditor watchdog timeouts (a hanging verification command will hang again — the stored claim waits for an explicit resume). Provider hints (`retry_after`/`reset_at`) are honored when they fit the five-hour probe budget; a week-long hint is shown and held instead of scheduling a hidden week-long timer.
- **`/list` refuses to mutate on a stale extension context**: `warnIfStaleAtEntry` probes at entry (as since v0.28.1), but `cmdList` previously discarded the probe's return and mutated anyway — `/list add` could ACTIVATE a goal in a doomed process, `/list clear` could wipe the queue from a session that could not announce it. Now every `/list` mutation path (add/remove/next/clear/cancel) returns the standard recovery message on a stale handle and touches nothing; the drafting path was already guarded.
- **Contract-text semantics for tweak flows** (goal + list): a supplied `Done when: …` clause REPLACES the stored contract, an omitted clause PRESERVES it, and a bare `Done when:` marker CLEARS it — a reword must not silently destroy the verification gate; clearing is an explicit act. `extractVerificationContract` exposes the explicit-clear signal to every caller.
- **Mode-aware command guidance**: generated auditor, stall, continuation, and pause guidance renders `/goal …` for standalone goals and `/list …` for list items — source pins (no hardcoded `/goal <cmd>` literals in generated guidance or widget strings), behavioral, and widget regressions.

### 0.34.52 — settings UI stale-context hardening

- **Bare `/glla` (the settings surface) probes at entry**: on a stale extension context the settings table refuses to open wholesale (every table choice writes state), and the mutating actions `/glla wipe`, `cancel`, `reviewer`, `postaudit`, `tooloverride` refuse with the standard recovery message and a `settings_mutation_refused_stale` ledger trail. Read-only surfaces stay usable with the recovery warning.

### 0.34.53 — settings command routing

- **`/list settings` no longer falls into natural-language drafting**: `/list`'s dump routing treated any unknown first word as an item seed, so the word "settings" started a drafting interview. The verb is now handled explicitly BEFORE the dump fallthrough: a clear redirect naming the supported settings command (`/glla`), ledgered as `list_settings_redirect`, never a drafting seed. `/list add settings …` keeps working (the explicit add verb remains the only way an item literally named "settings" enters the queue).

### 0.34.54 — lifecycle-recovery harness

- **Behavioral proof for list and settings recovery after session replacement**: the harness demonstrates Phase 1 (stale handle — pi replaced the session, no successor event): `/list show` accompanies its read with the standard recovery warning and does NOT silently pretend success; settings refuse to open or write. Phase 2 (fresh `session_start` arrives): `/list show` renders cleanly with no stale residue and the settings table renders again.

### 0.34.55 — command-registration collision model

- **Hermetic model of pi's command merge semantics** (read from the installed pi core's loader, never modified): each extension keeps its own commands Map (within-extension re-registration = last wins); `resolveRegisteredCommands()` flattens extensions IN LOAD ORDER and suffixes EVERY registration of a duplicated name (`name:1`, `name:2`, …) — the bare command name becomes owned by NOBODY, so dispatch cannot route `/list` at all while a collision exists. The routing table is auto-recorded to `audit/command-registration-routing.md`; the diagnostic is reproducible and does not change installed pi core.

### 0.34.56 — auditor unmatched telemetry

- **Unmatched tool starts/ends are represented as explicitly unmatched facts, never falsely paired**: telemetry regression coverage plus worker/parent/widget updates keep the report surface truthful when a tool start or end has no counterpart.

### 0.34.57 — quota walls engage the recovery machinery in minutes, not 15

- **Knowledge-window escalation**: a surfaced long-lived failure (quota / billing / auth) records a 30-minute knowledge window. A send-rearm storm inside that window escalates into the recovery envelope after 3 minutes of failed sends (plus the unchanged 5-minute activity-silence gate) instead of the generic 15 minutes — a wedge right after a quota wall is almost always the same wall, and blind re-sends into it are pure waste.
- **Transient failures stay fast**: 5xx/stream/network failures are short-lived by definition, never record the knowledge signal, and keep the fast error ladder plus the pi-core retry budget.
- **Armed by configuration**: the envelope is inert without `mainModelFallbacks` (rotation); an empty list means "park and probe the same model" instead of switching pools. Field evidence (2026-08-05): 89+ quota signals in the live ledger, zero `main_model_*` recovery events before this fix — the v0.34.51+ envelope never engaged because rotation was unset and pi's internal retry absorbed the 429s.

## 0.34.50 — 2026-08-04

### Fixed — make the host/auditor boundary explicit

- Active auditing HUDs now identify both sides of the lifecycle: `MAIN HOST ·
  SUPERVISING` and `AUDITOR · DETACHED · LIVE`.
- The widget card and status bar no longer leave the operator to infer whether
  the visible pi session itself became detached; only the read-only auditor
  worker is detached.
- Added display regressions for queued and live auditor states.

## 0.34.49 — 2026-08-04

### Fixed — detached-auditor report display

- Assemble streamed auditor text deltas into cumulative logical lines before
  exposing them to the live HUD, so punctuation and words no longer appear as
  separate `latest:` entries while preserving the exact verdict output.
- Keep the auditor compact and evidence-gated like the MAIN activity HUD: the
  detached role remains explicit, while report telemetry follows MAIN's
  cumulative streaming semantics.
- Added worker, parent, and widget regressions for split report fragments and
  think-block-safe display.

### Fixed — drafting recovery after session replacement

- Clear ephemeral goal/list/loop drafting state when a MAIN session shuts down,
  rebinds, or is silently replaced.
- Stale drafting seeds now abort cleanly instead of leaving the interview gate
  latched and making later list mutations look disallowed until restart.
- Late confirmations from a disposed generation cannot create goals or list
  items in the replacement session; stale dialogs remain infrastructure
  interruptions, not user rejections.

## 0.34.48 — 2026-08-04

### Fixed — detached completion-auditor recovery

- Release the MAIN when a detached completion auditor times out, exits, or
  loses its session without a verdict, while preserving the completion claim.
- Persist infrastructure `blocked — no verdict` state and require explicit
  resume for exactly one fresh audit dispatch instead of retrying blindly.
- Make the HUD distinguish the attached MAIN host from the detached auditor
  and add regressions for stale callbacks, silent host loss, and recovery.

### Fixed — quota recovery state

- Persisted an explicit empty main-model recovery slot so a successful retry
  cannot resurrect an older `QUOTA WALL` after reload or state reconstruction.
- A successful provider retry now reactivates work that glla itself parked,
  while leaving user decision/error pauses untouched.
- Classified specific plan/billing quota messages before generic `429` text;
  MiniMax Token Plan code 2062 is no longer treated as an ordinary throttle;
  no-hint plan walls start with slower hourly probes.
- Added regression coverage for plan-vs-rate-limit precedence, output-token
  separation, and recovery resumption.

## 0.34.47 — 2026-08-04

### Improved — live activity signal

- Added a compact animated pulse waveform inside the live status capsule so
  active work is visually obvious at a glance.
- Kept the waveform evidence-gated: it appears only with fresh stream/tool
  activity and never represents completion percentage.
- Added coverage for signal animation, semantic peak/body colors, and detached
  auditor live badges.

## 0.34.46 — 2026-08-04

### Improved — compact activity HUD

- Replaced the animated live orbit with stable `[LIVE · WORKING]`,
  `[QUEUED]`, `[BUSY]`, `[IDLE]`, and `[ACTIVE]` capsules.
- Kept stream age, elapsed time, task progress, and queue counts visible in a
  screenshot-friendly order; no liveness is inferred from animation.
- Added golden coverage for the compact queued/live readouts and updated the
  README examples.

## 0.34.45 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — bounded quota recovery and npm release discipline

- Classify quota walls conservatively; ambiguous transient, auth, and billing
  messages no longer masquerade as timed quota resets.
- Parse provider retry/reset hints, cap automatic probes at five hours, and
  stop the automatic recovery window after 24 hours with durable manual-resume
  guidance. Recovery metadata survives reloads.
- Apply the bounded plan to stored completion-auditor claims as well as the
  main supervised model.
- Add a GitHub Release → npm Trusted Publishing workflow, package inspection
  script, and maintainer release checklist.
- Clarify `/goal audit "focus"` syntax and the quota/recovery behavior in the
  README.

## 0.34.44 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — quota-wall recovery HUD

- Added a distinct `QUOTA WALL` status/card treatment with a live next-probe
  countdown, queued-item context, and saved-work guidance.
- Kept raw provider 429/plan JSON out of the visual card while retaining the
  durable reason and ledger evidence.
- Documented why bounded request retries plus durable `15m → 30m → hourly`
  probes are safer than increasing blind retries for multi-hour plan caps.

## 0.34.43 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — long-running list queue trail

- Added a compact above-editor queue trail for active `/list` items showing
  the waiting count, immediate next item, and valid wait age.
- Documented the evidence-gated aurora activity HUD, BUSY/QUEUED/IDLE states,
  and long-running list visuals in the README.

## 0.34.42 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — aurora orbit activity HUD

- Replaced the comet badge with a compact curved-corner orbit that cycles a
  spark through an indeterminate live-work capsule.
- Added layered semantic colors for the orbit, spark, separators, and phase
  labels while keeping the status bar as the single activity surface.

## 0.34.41 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — neon live-work pulse

- Replaced the plain equalizer wave with a looping comet that visibly travels
  through the activity badge without implying completion progress.
- Added layered semantic colors for the animated rails, spark, and LIVE label
  so the single status-bar HUD reads as an intentional visual effect.

## 0.34.40 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — one activity HUD

- Centralized LIVE, BUSY, QUEUED, IDLE, and stream-age indicators in the
  persistent status bar instead of repeating them in the above-editor card.
- Kept the card focused on the objective, durable state, recent action, queue,
  and concrete detached-auditor observations.
- Retained the animated evidence-backed wave as the single live-work pulse.

## 0.34.39 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — live activity has a visual language

- Replaced the tiny spinner with an animated terminal wave badge for
  evidence-backed live work.
- Active cards now use distinct `LIVE · WORKING`, `BUSY`, and `QUEUED` badges
  while preserving truthful stream/tool semantics.
- Detached verification now has a dedicated `AUDITOR · DETACHED · READ-ONLY`
  badge, with the live wave shown only when worker telemetry is fresh.

## 0.34.38 — 2026-08-03

### Improved — truthful live-work display

- Active goals now distinguish durable `active` state from `working`, `busy`,
  and `queued` host states.
- A green animated pulse appears only after recent real pi stream/tool
  evidence; a busy-but-silent provider is shown statically with its last stream
  time instead of looking productive.
- Detached auditors use the same evidence-bound pulse and retain their special
  auditor identity, phase, worker-activity age, and read-only tool details.

## 0.34.37 — 2026-08-03

### Hardened — continuation and auditor recovery

- A loop whose accepted continuation never produces a start proof now stops
  durably as stalled instead of remaining falsely active; `/loop resume`
  explicitly re-arms it.
- Compaction is covered end-to-end: a timed-out dispatch is released for one
  post-compaction resync attempt rather than remaining hidden behind the
  dispatch stand-down.
- Output-token-limit detection includes provider error metadata, not only
  visible assistant text, so max-output failures receive deterministic-wall
  handling.
- Stored completion-audit retries now persist the consecutive infrastructure
  failure streak instead of resetting the breaker on every manual retry.
- Detached workers handle nested RPC stream errors and early child exits so
  infrastructure failures publish an atomic result instead of dying before
  `result.json`.

## 0.34.36 — 2026-08-03

### Hardened — detached auditor telemetry and verdict boundaries

- Detached progress is now owned by the goal ID and logical audit attempt, so
  cancelled or replaced goals cannot repaint the live widget from a late worker
  callback.
- Overlapping read-only tools keep the remaining active tool visible and keep
  the worker watchdog from treating active work as silence.
- Progress and tool-history telemetry are bounded, terminal progress is written
  before the result, and long path arguments remain valid/safely targetable.
- Verdict parsing strips private `<think>` blocks first; a marker inside a
  reasoning block cannot approve a completion. Unterminated streamed blocks are
  suppressed from display too.
- Added a real parent/worker phase-transition test, overlap coverage, stale
  ownership pins, and configurable-stall messaging coverage.

## 0.34.35 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — detached auditor work is visible

The live widget now surfaces observed detached-worker phases (`starting`,
`thinking`, `tool executing`, and `producing report`), the current or last
read-only tool, a safe file target, and the latest sanitized report-stream
line. The parent preserves this telemetry instead of reducing every run to a
moving timer and `auditor: running`. Startup no longer renders a fake
`last activity 0s ago`, and worker progress snapshots are serialized so an
older generic snapshot cannot overwrite a newer tool phase.

## 0.34.34 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — disapproval feedback is never empty

Detached auditor disapprovals now notify a bounded report excerpt directly and
keep the actionable `Required fixes` tail on the always-visible attention card.
This remains useful when the host accepts a continuation but never starts the
turn that would otherwise receive the returned report. Regression-shield gaps
also notify their missing contract items directly.

## 0.34.33 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — widget lines stay inside their TUI box

String-array widgets reserve pi-tui's left and right padding when budgeting
objectives, loop targets, and detail lines. Every emitted widget line is also
cell-width clamped, so long objectives no longer wrap a trailing elapsed
segment such as `50s` onto a stray line.

## 0.34.32 — 2026-08-03

### Changed — `/glla` cleanly separates settings from actions

`/glla` with no arguments opens the settings table. Nonempty arguments are
reserved for operational actions such as `status`, `resume`, `stats`, and
`audits`; the old top-level `/glla key=value` setting syntax is rejected with a
clear message. Settings are edited through the table, avoiding noisy inline
assignment commands.

## 0.34.31 — 2026-08-03

### Added — main-session model backups and durable quota recovery

The main session can now be configured with ordered global backup models via
`mainmodelbackups` / the settings table. Provider and quota failures rotate to
the next authenticated candidate without treating a retry acceptance as a
started turn. If every candidate is unavailable, supervised work is parked in
a durable recovery wait that probes at 15m, 30m, then hourly forever. A
provider-held send-retry storm is cancelled and enters the same recovery path,
so a quota window returning hours later resumes saved work without manual
intervention or blind resend spinning.

## 0.34.30 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — auditor verdicts no longer look like missing verdicts

Active goals now distinguish a genuine auditor disapproval and a regression
shield evidence rejection from an auditor infrastructure failure. The former
show the verdict and the required fix; only the latter says **blocked — no
verdict** and **completion claim was not evaluated**. Added display regressions
for both screenshot cases.

## 0.34.29 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — audit fan-out honors draft auto-acceptance

When `autoAcceptDrafts` is enabled, the `/list audit` completion fan-out now
queues generated finding items without opening a second confirmation dialog.
The default remains Confirm-gated, and the fan-out ledger plus notification
record when the explicit auto-accept setting was used.

## 0.34.28 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — active work and detached-auditor progress no longer look green or vanish

- The live status/widget now distinguishes **awaiting first turn**, **working**,
  and long-lived **idle** gaps instead of presenting every active snapshot as
  green progress. Idle display is delayed long enough to avoid flickering during
  normal eager-continuation handoff.
- Detached completion audits now surface **queued**, **running**, **quiet**,
  **blocked**, and **awaiting verdict** phases. The worker's real activity
  timestamp is carried through the parent transport and shown separately from
  UI polling; queued state is rendered immediately before worker progress.
- Late `pause_goal` calls can no longer overwrite an already paused or auditing
  lifecycle, preventing repeated false stops from stale turn/tool callbacks.
- Added display and behavioral regressions for first-turn/idle rendering,
  auditor phase transitions, worker activity, queued visibility, and late-pause
  protection.

## 0.34.27 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — host-session recovery no longer parks on the wrong boundary

The screenshots from the fleet exposed two different failures that had been
rendered as the same red "host session lost" state:

- An accepted continuation whose trigger never produced a turn-start event is
  now shown as **turn start not observed**. Automatic re-sends remain stopped
  after the bounded proof timeout, but `/goal resume` or `/list resume` is the
  truthful one-shot recovery path; `/reload` is no longer implied unless the
  handle is actually stale.
- A stale host handle can now rebind when the first successor contact is
  `session_start`, `message_start`, `tool_result`, `tool_call`,
  `before_agent_start`, `message_update`, `agent_start`, or `turn_start`.
  Plain `startup` is accepted only for a same-workspace, file-backed successor
  with a dead recorded owner; in-memory pi-subagent sessions and different
  worktrees remain fail-closed. The generation and durable dispatch guards
  still prevent late old-context sends or duplicate recovery turns.
- Recovery state keeps the owner workspace with the dead-owner identity, so a
  file-backed context from another project cannot claim the parked goal plane.

Added behavioral coverage for every first-contact boundary, plain-startup
successor rebinding, subagent refusal, and truthful no-turn-start display.

## 0.34.26 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — output-token-limit exhaustion is a durable, explicit failure state

Repeated truncation used to end in a transient notify while the goal stayed
green-active: the sticky give-up flag meant every heartbeat re-kick silently
truncated again with no state, no card, and no way out.

- Length-continue exhaustion (stopReason "length" 3× in a row) now durably
  pauses an active goal/list item with `pauseKind: "error"`, a reason naming
  the output-token limit, and actionable guidance (re-scope into smaller
  pieces, then `/goal resume`); the tracker resets so the explicit resume
  gets a fresh truncation budget. A running loop stops with an explicit
  output-token-limit reason (iteration preserved). Plain chat keeps the
  transient notify — there is nothing to pause. Ledger:
  `length_continue_exhausted`.
- The 5-consecutive-error brake now classifies provider error text matching
  `/output[ -]?token|max_?tokens|length limit|output length|too many tokens/i`
  as a deterministic output-token-limit wall: the pause names the real wall
  instead of generic "5 consecutive errors", and there is no flake
  auto-resume ladder, no wait-timer, and no hourly probes — blind retries
  never help a deterministic rejection; only re-scoping does.

## 0.34.25 — 2026-08-03

### Fixed — silent host-session swap: same-host successor absorbed, work auto-resumes

pi can replace the host session WITHOUT delivering `session_start` (the silent
swap around compaction): the extension handle goes stale, the goal parked
forever as "host session lost — waiting for fresh session_start", and the live
replacement session's own tool calls were refused as foreign — the user had to
`/reload` by hand to recover (observed fleet-wide: deathrun, hegemon, pulis,
and the maintainer's own session).

The replacement host session is alive and reaches glla through ordinary tool
calls and events — that contact IS the liveness signal:

- `tryAbsorbHostSuccessor(ctx, via)`: a foreign ctx that is file-backed
  (`sessionManager.getSessionFile()` truthy — pi-subagents workers are
  `SessionManager.inMemory` and stay refused) while the recorded owner is
  provably dead is absorbed as the goal-plane owner: rebind, generation bump,
  stale-terminal state cleared, loud `session_rebind_via_live_ctx` ledger +
  notify, heartbeat restart, and the interrupted goal/list item auto-resumes
  with lifecycle-rebind consent semantics (one forced continuation dispatch —
  the 0.34.24 start-proof watchdog still stands down durably if it goes
  silent). Absorption runs at every contact point: tool calls, `rememberCtx`,
  `session_compact` (the field's most common post-swap contact), `agent_end`.
- `deadOwnerSession`: `clearSessionOwnedTimers` nulls `ownerSession` at the
  stale terminal; the dead identity is now kept so absorption can still tell
  "replacement host session" from "ephemeral worker" after the park — and so
  the null-owner gap no longer lets any live subagent ctx mutate a parked
  plane (fail-closed preserved and tightened).
- Ambiguity fails closed: owner still probe-live → no absorption; a
  zombie-stood-down instance never reclaims the plane; `session_start`
  (healthy lifecycle path) supersedes the silent-swap record.

Four behavioral tests pin it: tool-call absorption with auto-resume, in-memory
subagent refusal while parked, the field ordering (stale before compaction,
then the successor's `session_compact` absorbs in place), and the dead-owner
ephemeral-claim lockout.

## 0.34.24 — 2026-08-02

### Fixed — accepted continuation dispatches now require start proof

Goal, loop, stall-warning, and output-length follow-ups now persist a
versioned, generation/owner-bound dispatch record before calling
`sendMessage({ triggerTurn: true })`. A successful API return is treated as
accepted—not started—until `before_agent_start` or a compatible low-level start
signal arrives. An accepted dispatch that never starts times out, records a
durable unresolved sidecar, stops automatic re-sends, and leaves the work safe
for a fresh session or explicit resume. Older stale-context and lifecycle
handoff behavior remains unchanged.

### Fixed — control characters stay out of display projections

Objective, loop-target, pause, status, widget, confirmation, and notification
projections now remove terminal and zero-width formatting controls without
mutating persisted objective, contract, prompt, ledger, or audit data.

### Added — dispatch and display regression coverage

Added atomic dispatch-sidecar/state-machine tests, owner/generation start-proof
coverage, behavioral acknowledgement coverage, and control-character display
regressions.

## 0.34.23 — 2026-08-02

### Fixed — host replacement rebinds across a new SessionManager

A host `session_start` for `/new`, `/resume`, `/fork`, or `/reload` is no
longer discarded as a foreign subagent event merely because pi supplied a new
`SessionManager`. When pi omits the preceding `session_shutdown`, glla clears
old timers, claims the fresh context, and records the rebind. Ordinary
subagent `startup` events remain isolated.

### Added — replacement-without-shutdown regression coverage

Behavioral coverage now proves that a replacement with a different
`SessionManager` resumes the goal and that a foreign subagent startup cannot
steal ownership.

## 0.34.22 — 2026-08-02

### Changed — completion auditing leaves the main pi turn free

`complete_goal` now persists the claim and queues an extension-less auditor in
an external worker process. The main pi tool returns immediately instead of
awaiting a nested `AgentSession`; durable request/progress/result files and
attempt hashes let a fresh lifecycle consume the result without trusting a
stale generation. The worker launches RPC pi with only `read`, `grep`, `find`,
`ls`, and `bash`, inherits provider authentication without copying secrets,
and never mutates goal state.

Auditor status now distinguishes detached queued/running work from recovery
pending. Goal cancellation clears the pending claim and best-effort terminates
the worker. Worker inactivity remains a 10-minute no-event bound (unless a
read-only tool is active), and the total audit remains capped at 30 minutes;
these are infrastructure failures, never verdicts.

### Added — detached-worker lifecycle coverage

Added transport protocol/identity tests and behavioral coverage proving that
`complete_goal` returns before a worker result, approvals archive, disapprovals
resume, and old-generation results cannot archive after replacement.

## 0.34.21 — 2026-08-02

### Fixed — completion audits expose and recover their lifecycle

Completion claims now persist an explicit auditor phase and attempt metadata.
A fresh session converts an interrupted or legacy claim to
`recovery-pending`, displays that state instead of falsely saying the auditor
is running, and immediately retries it when lifecycle/auto-resume consent is
present. Cold startup with auto-resume off waits for `/goal resume`; old
attempts cannot finalize or archive a replacement goal.

The isolated auditor still aborts after 10 minutes with no events while no
read-only tool is active, permits a long-running verification tool to finish,
and now has a 30-minute wall-clock safety cap. These are infrastructure
failures, never verdicts; stored claims remain available for direct retry.

### Added — lifecycle and watchdog regression coverage

Behavioral replacement/recovery tests, recovery-pending display tests, schema
compatibility checks, and watchdog timing tests cover the new paths.

## 0.34.20 — 2026-08-02

### Fixed — delayed work rebinds instead of using registration-time contexts

Agent tools now resolve the invocation's current `ExtensionContext` instead of
retaining the context from their first registration. Quota retries, completion
audits, audit fan-out confirmation, loop measurements, and branch cleanup carry
a session generation and fail closed when it changes. Completion claims are
persisted before auditing, manual resume consumes stored claims through the
isolated auditor directly, and old auditor finalizers cannot clear a fresh
session's in-flight state.

### Added — stale delayed-context regression coverage

Added behavioral and source-level checks for replacement-context tool calls,
generation-guarded quota/audit/fan-out paths, stored-claim recovery, loop async
cleanup, and the no-old-context rule.

## [0.34.19] — 2026-08-02

### Fixed — stale sessions fail closed across compaction and lifecycle gaps

Delayed glla callbacks now carry a session generation and cannot re-arm after
shutdown, stale-handle termination, or `/reload`. Late `session_compact`,
`agent_end`, and `tool_result` events from a disposed session cannot reclaim the
old context or schedule another continuation. Stale terminal handling paints
the interrupted state immediately, and the widget explicitly says the host
session was lost and points to `/reload` plus the appropriate resume command.
Ephemeral watchdog counters reset on a fresh session so a stale boundary cannot
leak a false stall count into the next run. The exact stale-before-compaction,
no-`session_start` field ordering is covered behaviorally.

### Fixed — context-starved length stops yield to pi compaction

A tiny `length` stop at a nearly full context is classified as context
starvation rather than a real output cap. glla records the deferral and lets pi
compact instead of sending a redundant one-token continuation into the full
context. Older pi/test doubles without context-usage support retain the legacy
path.

## [0.34.18] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — autoresume waits for the initial transcript

A blank initial `startup` runtime is now an initialization barrier: global
`autoResume` cannot activate a persisted goal, list head, or loop before pi
has loaded a conversation. The wait is visible and ledgered, while an explicit
`/goal resume`, `/list` activation, or `/loop` start remains a deliberate
escape hatch. Startup sessions that already contain conversation history keep
autoresuming normally.

## [0.34.17] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — stale runtimes never call the old pi API

`notifyExternal` now exits before reading notification settings or calling
`pi.exec` when the extension is stale or a lifecycle handoff is pending. The
orphan warning remains best-effort through the local UI, but an invalidated
runtime cannot accidentally invoke its old `pi` handle.

## [0.34.16] — 2026-08-01

### Changed — stale recovery crosses pi's lifecycle, not the terminal

The automatic `/reload` transport is gone. When pi announces
`session_shutdown`, glla now records a fresh, same-process continuation debt in
`.pi-glla/session-handoff.json`, records the shutdown reason, and clears every
session-owned timer (continuations, loop ticks, queue probes, heartbeat/UI
intervals, quota retry, and settle callbacks). A fresh `session_start` rebinds
the new context and consumes only matching, fresh debt; the old context cannot
send after handoff.

`reason: "quit"` is explicit user stop: it is ledgered as
`session_handoff_suppressed`, leaves no debt, and does not receive same-pid
rebind consent. A true orphan still gets an honest warning — the invalidated
extension cannot repair its own pi host, so restart pi normally if no fresh
lifecycle event arrives. The retained `autoReloadOnStale` and `autoRecovery`
settings are deprecated compatibility fields and no longer select a transport.

The queue-stuck probe also resolves a fresh context when it fires instead of
retaining the sender context. This keeps the confirmed queued-without-a-turn
wedge visible without allowing a stale timer to touch an invalid handle.

## [0.34.15] — 2026-08-01

Hegemon field evidence: an evening where every safety layer fired correctly
(two stale-reload cycles, two `auto_recovery_reload`s, the error-brake
ladder) yet the tab still needed manual babysitting — because of three
gaps, all fixed here.

### Fixed — the error-brake ladder resets on every /reload

`errorBrakeStreak` was module state, so each auto-recovery `/reload` zeroed
it: the escalating cooldown restarted at 1 minute and the 6-brake park +
hourly top-of-hour probes (v0.29.9, built for exactly multi-hour quota
walls) could never engage. A hard-exhausted MiniMax plan churned 1-minute
probes for an hour. The rung now persists **on the goal**
(`errorBrakeStreak`, type + schema), cleared by a healthy turn as before —
the park and hourly probes finally work across reloads.

### Fixed — quota walls are classified on the pause card

The brake carried the raw 429 JSON in `detail` (v0.28.5) but the card never
said what it MEANT — the user kept resuming into a dead plan. When the
error text matches rate-limit/quota patterns, the pause reason, suggested
action, and notifications now say plainly: **"Provider quota/rate-limit
wall — resuming won't help until the window resets. Switch /model to a
different provider to continue now."**

### Added — queue-stuck probe: dead triggers confirmed in ~45s, not ~10min

New wedge shape from the same evening: pi **accepted** the continuation
(footer "1 queued") but the turn trigger was dead — the message sat queued
while pi idled. The 0.34.11 watchdog gates on "pi reported NO pending"
(by design, it hunts the other hole), and the stall ladder needs 5 stalls
over ~10 minutes to escalate. A send that lands queued-without-a-turn is a
CONFIRMED dead trigger (hegemon law), so a one-shot probe now fires ~45s
(`GLLA_QUEUE_STUCK_MS` override) after every landed goal/loop send: still
queued + still idle + zero real activity → `queue_stuck_detected` →
auto-recovery `/reload` immediately (loud fallback when recovery is
unavailable). A consumed message — even an instant-429 error turn consumes
it — or any real activity disarms the probe, so quota churn and healthy
turns never false-trigger.

## [0.34.14] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — the 4-hour audit loop: stalled audits reset their own circuit breaker

Pully field evidence: a goal spent **4h06m** in `auditing`, cycling a
10-minute stall → abort → resubmit → stall loop ~24 times. Root cause: a
stalled auditor returns the partial output it streamed before the abort —
non-empty, so `auditorRan` was true — and the v0.28.5 streak-clear fired on
it, resetting `auditInfraStreak` every cycle. The 3-strike loud-pause
breaker could never engage. (The hang itself: the auditor's verification
commands — ssh/sudo fleet checks — blocked its stream; every healthy rig's
audits complete in minutes.) The streak now clears only on a **clean** run
(`auditorRan && !result.error`) — 3 consecutive infrastructure failures
pause loudly as designed, and the pause text now names BOTH causes: model
broken **or a verification command hanging**.

### Fixed — /reload rebind always resumes ("the list is not continuing")

After a manual `/reload`, an active goal held for `/glla resume` when
`autoresume=off` — a full stop in the middle of live work, against the
keep-going directive. The extension runs inside pi, so `process.pid` IS
pi's pid: a new instance that finds its own pid in the `session-owner.json`
sidecar is a `/reload` rebuild of a LIVE session, not a cold boot — and
rebinds now always resume active goals/loops (ledger `rebind_resume`).
Cold boots (new pid) still honor `autoresume=off`. This composes with the
0.34.13 recovery marker: marker → recovery consent, pid → rebind consent,
neither → the autoresume setting decides.

### Test-suite hygiene

Four pins broke silently across the last releases (slice windows as
`heartbeatTick` grows, a comment shadowing an `indexOf` ordering pin, a
README rephrase from the 0.34.8 companions arc) — all fixed, and the
verification habit tightened: explicit pass/fail counts, never a bare
tail line.

## [0.34.13] — 2026-08-01

### Added — auto-recovery ladder: keep going unless we MUST stop

User directive: "we would want to keep going unless we must stop like a
question or we are done." Every wedge class that used to end in
"tell the user to /glla resume" now tries to heal itself first:

- **Unanswered continuation (2.5min watchdog)** → glla injects `/reload`
  into its own tmux/WezTerm pane (v0.29.13 transport), writing a sidecar
  `recovery-resume.json` marker first. The fresh instance consumes the
  marker and **resumes the goal/loop even when autoresume=off** — the
  consent came from the recovery act, not the restore-time setting.
  Markers are single-use and 5-minute-fresh, so an abandoned recovery
  can't surprise-resume a later session.
- **Send-retry storm (both loop + goal branches)** and **stall
  escalation** → same recovery attempt before the loud pause/stop. Only
  if recovery is unavailable (setting off, no multiplexer) or already
  throttled does the pause fire as before.
- **Throttled to one auto-recovery per 10 minutes.** A wedge recurring
  inside the window is the transcript-writer-dead class — the one failure
  a `/reload` genuinely cannot cure — and THAT reaches you as a loud stop
  naming the real cure: restart pi in the tab, then `/glla resume`.
- Throttle stamp happens only after a successful injection (a
  no-transport skip must not mislabel the next wedge as restart-class).
- New setting `autoRecovery` (default **on**, opt-out via
  `/glla settings` file) alongside `autoReloadOnStale`.
- Ledgers: `auto_recovery_reload {where}`,
  `send_rearm_escalated_suppressed {reason: "auto-recovery reload"}`,
  `stall_escalated_suppressed {reason: "auto-recovery reload"}`.

What still stops for a human, by design: DECIDE questions, done goals,
5-consecutive user aborts, error brakes, and the pi-restart class above.

## [0.34.12] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — the 60-seconds-per-turn blackhole tax ("keeps stopping with lists")

Hellhunter field evidence: after its pi restart, every turn cycle paid a
~60s heartbeat tax. The eager continuation fires AT `agent_end` — exactly
pi's turn-teardown blackhole window — so it vanished, and the 60-second
heartbeat refire did the real work. The ledger showed the tell:
`goal_continuation_sent` pairs with a refire in between, one micro-turn per
cycle. The eager send now settles **2.5s past agent_end** — teardown
completes, the send lands, the next turn starts immediately. 2.5s per turn
instead of 60. (Test-suite override: `GLLA_EAGER_SETTLE_MS=0` in the
preload, so `tick()` flushes are unaffected.) The 0.34.11
unanswered-continuation watchdog remains the net underneath for the cases
the settle doesn't dodge.

### Added — live countdown on timed wait-pauses

The status line now counts down (`⏳ waiting · resumes in 23m`, then
`resuming…` once the moment passes) instead of showing a static clock time
— and the 1s UI ticker keeps rendering through a timed wait-pause so the
countdown actually ticks. (Pully field request 2026-08-01: "we could use a
countdown — it should have resumed by now.")

## [0.34.11] — 2026-08-01

### Added — unanswered-continuation watchdog (the "keeps stopping with lists" killer)

Hellhunter, 2026-08-01: at a list-transition completion boundary pi
ACCEPTED every continuation (`sendMessage` never threw, the session
reported idle) but started NO turn — transcript frozen, token counter
flat, 10+ minutes of heartbeat refires into the void. This shape fell
between every existing net: the pending-latch watchdog needs
idle&&pending (pi reported no pending), the zombie-run watchdog needs
busy (pi reported idle), the wedge alert needs 30 minutes. New watchdog:
a continuation was sent and **no real activity** (`agent_end`/`tool_call`)
has occurred since — armed at 2.5 minutes, re-alerting every 5. The alert
says the cure out loud ("Re-sends don't unstick it. Cure: /reload —
autoresume re-fires the goal/list item automatically") since re-sends are
hegemon-proven not to unstick a dropped trigger; the heartbeat keeps
refiring underneath in case pi self-recovers. A landed turn — even a lazy
text-only one — disarms it, so no false positives on slow models.

### Fixed

- The v0.34.7 pin file referenced `path` without importing it — bun's
  runner doesn't typecheck so it sailed through three releases; tsc is
  green again.

## [0.34.10] — 2026-08-01

### Docs — companions moved up the storefront

Recommended companions now sits immediately after Quick start (it was
buried below Config/Subagents/Token guard/Wedge alert — an
effectively-required dependency has no business at line 315), and the
Quick start install block carries the `rpiv-ask-user-question` install
line directly, so a newcomer gets both packages in one copy-paste.

## [0.34.9] — 2026-08-01

### Docs — rpiv-ask-user-question promoted to effectively required

The Recommended companions section now leads with
`@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question` as **install this one**: the /goal
drafting interview, DECIDE findings, and every confirm dialog are built
around its structured multi-select/preview questions; the prose fallback
without it is functional but not the product.

## [0.34.8] — 2026-08-01

### Docs — Recommended companions

New README section: the four plugins that round glla out into a full rig
— `@tintinweb/pi-subagents` (the Agent tool glla's fan-out prompts assume),
`@juicesharp/rpiv-advisor` (mid-flight second opinion; advisory only, the
isolated auditor remains the only completion gate),
`@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question` (structured drafting/DECIDE forms),
and `@pi-unipi/notify` (remote push beyond glla's built-in desktop
notifications — route it to critical events only or every pause pings
twice). The Compatibility section's "goes well with it" paragraph now
points at it instead of repeating a partial list.

## [0.34.7] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — SEV-1: a stale ctx during the DECIDE fan-out CRASHED pi outright

Darklord, 2026-08-01: a `/reload` landed 58 minutes into a list-audit
collect; when the goal completed, `archiveCurrentGoal` (sync) floated
`fanOutListAuditFindings`, whose DECIDE-raise `sendUserMessage` hit pi's
`assertActive` stale-ctx throw; the floating promise turned it into an
uncaughtException and **pi exited mid-audit**. Two layers of fix:

- **`safeSteerUser(ctx, text)`** — every orchestrator-path
  `sendUserMessage` (DECIDE raise, reviewer follow-up, drafting seed,
  decide-answer) now probes staleness first and catches anyway; a stale
  send becomes a `steer_skipped_stale` ledger entry, never a crash. A pin
  asserts the helper's own send line is the real API call (a regex edit
  briefly rewrote it into infinite recursion — every steer silently
  no-opped; the /goal decide behavioral test caught it).
- **The float carries a catch** — `void fanOutListAuditFindings(ctx)` is
  now `.catch(...)`-guarded with a `list_audit_fanout_error` ledger event,
  so ANY rejection there is a ledger line, not a process exit.

### Fixed — the re-kick clears the stale-handle banner

Junk-runner + polis + neonbreak, 2026-08-01: all three actively working
post-reload with `⚠ interrupted — stale handle` still screaming. The
v0.34.2 clear lived only in the paused-resume path; the v0.34.3 re-kick
bypassed it. Both re-kick branches (`/glla resume` and `/goal resume`) now
clear `interruptedAt`/`interruptedReason` — a manual resume in a fresh
session fulfills the marker's promise no matter which path it takes.

## [0.34.6] — 2026-08-01

### Added — the subagent strategy grows up: resume-don't-respawn + the restart law

Two field findings, one morning:

1. **A failed subagent's work is recoverable.** Verified in pi-subagents
   source: `resume()` has no status guard — it re-prompts the FAILED
   agent's existing session, context intact. The old law ("respawn
   narrower") threw away every dead agent's partial work — darklord's 56
   tool uses, junk-runner's 29+65. New law: RESUME first
   (`Agent(resume: "<id>", prompt: "Wrap up: report within ~150 lines")` —
   the agent already HAS its research, it only needs to report); respawn
   only on "not found".
2. **A restart kills subagents silently and forever.** π-games 2026-08-01:
   /reload mid-collect, 4 background Explore agents vanished — no ✗, no
   event, IDs unresumable (the manager registry is in-process RAM). The
   session sat idle "like we never had it" — and because the fan-out was
   ad-hoc (no glla goal — the ledger proves it), nothing re-drove it. New
   law: after a restart, check the transcript for in-flight agents and
   relaunch/absorb — never sit waiting for results that can never arrive —
   and put long fan-out passes under a goal/list item, because the goal
   plane is the ONLY thing that survives restarts.

## [0.34.5] — 2026-08-01

### Changed — the wedge alert is subagent-aware

Junk-runner, 2026-08-01: two Explore agents sat at "thinking…" for 31+
minutes (alive — counters kept moving — but indistinguishable from hung).
The 30-minute wedge alert covered the shape, but its message diagnosed a
"hung command (test/build/dev server)" — wrong advice when the in-flight
call is `get_subagent_result`/`Agent`. The alert now names the SUBAGENT
WAIT and carries the liveness protocol: a child whose tool-use/token
counters have stopped moving between checks is hung, not thinking (hard
failures — quota 429s, output-token-limit deaths — already surface as
✗ failed in the Agents panel and return the parent's wait; a HANG is the
silent case). Esc interrupts the wait; collect the survivors and absorb
the dead scope inline. The `wedge_alert` ledger event gains
`subagentWait: true|false` so the fleet can count the shape.

## [0.34.4] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — subagent brief discipline (the zero-text death was systematic, not an outlier)

Two field sightings, same shape, within minutes: darklord's audit fan-out
lost an Explore agent (56 tool uses, 258s) to `run hit the output token
limit before producing any text`; junk-runner lost TWO of four (29 and 65
tool uses — total losses), the survivors burning 320k+/140k+ tokens each.
The v0.34.0 law demanded the parallel fan-out shape but said nothing about
brief quality, so agents wrote subsystem-cloud briefs ("audit audio + dev +
tests + docs") and then tried to dump every finding into one giant final
report that blows the per-response output cap.

- **Brief discipline law** (continuation + both forever prompts + both audit
  templates): every subagent brief names a TIGHT scope (specific
  directories/files, not subsystem-clouds), a tool-use budget (~30-40
  calls), and a report cap (~150 lines) with the escape hatch "if you near
  the token limit, STOP exploring and report what you have — a partial
  report beats a dead one".
- **New section: WHEN SUBAGENTS DIE ON TOKEN LIMITS** — do NOT respawn the
  same wide brief (it dies the same way); SPLIT it into narrower agents or
  ABSORB the small remainder inline.

## [0.34.3] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — resume re-kicks an ACTIVE-but-idle goal instead of "Nothing to resume"

Hellhunter, 2026-08-01: the widget said `list item · active`, the agent sat
idle (a prose-only turn ended the previous item; the continuation that
should drive the new head never landed — continuation debt), and
`/glla resume` answered "Nothing to resume — no paused goal/list-item, no
held loop". Technically true, practically wrong: an ACTIVE-but-idle goal is
exactly what a user means by "resume".

- `/glla resume` now re-kicks: active goal → re-fires its continuation
  (steer when busy, followUp when idle); active loop → re-fires its tick;
  auditing → an informative "wait for the verdict" instead of a shrug.
- `/goal resume` (and `/list resume`, which routes there) does the same —
  was: a SILENT return on an active goal, so the user got literally nothing.
- One-active-thing is preserved: an active loop still wins over a goal
  re-kick with the usual warning.
- New ledger event `resume_rekick` — watch it to count how often the
  continuation-driving machinery drops the ball in the field; a hot count
  is evidence for a deeper driver-side fix.

## [0.34.2] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — manual resume clears the stale-handle interrupt marker

Hegemon, 2026-08-01: autoresume=off, goal held on restore, user resumed it
manually — and the status line kept screaming
`⚠ interrupted — stale handle · /reload → /glla resume` in error red while
the goal was actively working 22 minutes in. The marker's only clear-site
was the AUTORESUME restore path (v0.28.1); `cmdResume` cleared every pause
field but not `interruptedAt`. A manual resume fulfills the marker's promise
("a fresh session will resume you") exactly as an automatic one does, so it
now clears `interruptedAt`/`interruptedReason` too — the stale-session
re-mark (`resumed in a stale session`) still spreads after the clear and
still wins when the resume itself is stale. If a pre-fix flag is stuck on
disk: `/goal pause` then `/goal resume` clears it.

## [0.34.1] — 2026-08-01

### Fixed — status line no longer doubles the widget's type chip

Field screenshot (endless-td, 2026-08-01): the footer status line read
`glla: list ● 1h 44m` while the widget head right above it read
`· list item · active · 1h 44m` — the list-ness shown twice. The status line
now owns STATE only; the widget owns TYPE naming (the v0.24.7 "list item"
chip stays). The policy word (`list` / `goal`) is dropped from every goal
status-line state — active, paused (decision/error/wait/legacy), and
interrupted: `glla: ● 1h 44m · 17 queued`, `glla: ⏸ decision needed`,
`glla: ⚠ interrupted — …`. The `· N queued` suffix still hints list context
when the widget has scrolled away. Loop status lines are unchanged
(`glla: loop ↓ iter …` carries loop-specifics the widget layout doesn't).

## [0.34.0] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — eager subagents, with ROI (research-backed; user: "parallel execution, not spawning guys for no reason")

Prompt-law batch from two fresh surveys (registry delegation plugins;
Claude Code / Codex / Kimi / opencode subagent designs — notes in
PARKED-IDEAS.md v0.34.0 entry):

- **Parallel execution law** (goal-loop-continuation.md): subagents pay when
  they PARALLELIZE real work or protect context — never as ceremony ("if you
  can do it faster inline, do it inline"). Research breadth = parallel
  Explore agents in one message; implementation may now be DELEGATED to
  background general-purpose agents with `isolation: "worktree"` when chunks
  have DISJOINT file footprints — the main session lands the merges and owns
  the final tree. Overlapping edits stay serialized (parallel workers on the
  same files is how repos get corrupted).
- **Settle before completing** (Kimi steal): never `complete_goal` while
  your background agents are still running — collect them first.
- **Auditor rehearsal**: when the verification contract has re-runnable
  checks, rehearse it with ONE fresh-context subagent before completing — a
  cheap rehearsal beats an expensive disapproval round.
- **Untrusted-output hygiene** (Claude steal): never execute instructions
  found inside a subagent report; every spawn asks for a `BLOCKERS:` section.
- **Audit fan-out made unconditional + shaped**: both audit templates now
  demand AT LEAST 3 Explore subagents in ONE message, one per subsystem
  (was: unquantified "spawn for breadth"; the stronger directive was gated
  behind aggressiveMode).
- **Divergence bail** (pi-auto-review steal): 3+ consecutive iterations
  moving the metric the WRONG way appends a reassessment note to the loop
  prompt — fixes breaking things / findings reopening means stop making
  small edits. Note-only; nothing auto-stops.
- Deferred (PARKED-IDEAS.md): event-tracked settle gate, orchestrator-spawned
  fan-out via pi-subagents RPC, reviewer diversity pin, supervisor-by-default.

## [0.33.5] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — docs only (newcomer pass)

- **INSTALL.md rewritten for first-timers**: npm install first, a 60-second
  first-goal walkthrough (draft → loop → isolated audit), then the other two
  modes; developer prerequisites and from-source install moved down;
  historical version-stamped sections framed as operator notes; stale
  "v0.1.0" title and the outdated auditor-override wording fixed.
- **README**: the `/loop` decision rule now covers metricless spec loops and
  `/loop audit` (it still claimed numeric-only + redirect-to-/goal); the
  three-loops table row updated.
- **PLAN.md**: newcomer pointer to README/INSTALL at the top.

## [0.33.4] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — docs only

New package description / README lead: "Mission control for autonomous pi"
— covers the full surface (interview-drafted + confirmed goals, audited
queue, forever-loops, isolated auditor, stall recovery, decision pauses,
consent gates) instead of the old em-dash tagline that registry listings
truncated mid-sentence.

## [0.33.3] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — DECIDE findings are raised as real questions (hegemon field report)

The post-audit DECIDE block was a passive notify — truncated at 110 chars,
user-only, with nobody whose job it was to get the findings answered
(hegemon: the user typed "decide what" into the void while the drain ran
on). A decision is not a task — but it IS a question:

- **`/list audit` fan-out**: when DECIDE findings exist, the orchestrator
  now steers the agent with the FULL untruncated findings and a raise +
  record protocol: ask_user_question — one question per finding, options
  from the finding's own two sides plus "Defer" (prose fallback; Esc =
  Defer) — then record each answer in findings.md (`- [x] DECIDED: …` /
  `- [x] DEFERRED`) so decided items stop re-surfacing, and queue chosen
  work via list_add. Fires even when nothing new queued or the fan-out was
  declined. Ledger: `list_audit_decisions_raised`.
- **One-shot `/goal audit`**: the agent raises the questions itself BEFORE
  calling complete_goal (it's still in its turn); Done when now requires
  every DECIDE finding raised + recorded.
- The notify keeps a one-line pointer ("raising them as questions now")
  instead of the truncated `? …` dump.

670 tests.

## [0.33.2] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — loop proactiveness + respec machinery (two-lens design analysis)

A two-agent analysis of the loop logic found the loop **reactive, not
proactive** (intervention reasons specific, strategies generic; never
suggested a refine even when holding the evidence) plus two honesty bugs
and a termination leak for metricless loops. All closed:

**Proactiveness**
- **The plateau reprieve names the finding**: was "N findings open, pick
  the smallest" — now splices the top OPEN line from findings.md into
  the note (`countOpenAuditFindings` already parsed the file).
- **Saturated metric → the loop suggests the refine itself**: when the
  strategy note fires and lastValue == bestValue, it now says "the
  metric has been flat at best — call propose_loop_refine". The loop
  holds the evidence; it was silent.
- **Hypothesis feedback loop**: the HYPOTHESIS line went into the ledger
  but the prompt never reflected it. The next iteration now carries the
  verdict: "Last iteration you predicted X. Result: metric improved
  17 → 16 (best 16)."
- **Cosmetic-churn detection** (metricless doorknob leak): the stuck
  gate exempted ANY iteration with a file write — endless cosmetic edits
  burned forever. A write-exempted iteration whose reply is ~identical
  to the previous one now classifies as churn (note-only first rung;
  any genuinely different iteration resets it).

**Respec / spec evolution**
- **`/loop refine <text>`** is a real command (and `/loop polish` works
  as an alias — the widget footer advertised it before it existed). The
  operator's suggestion rides the next iteration's prompt; the agent
  proposes via propose_loop_refine, the user confirms.
- **`propose_loop_refine` gains `specText`/`specAppend`** (respec loops):
  the orchestrator owns the spec-file write on confirm — the agent never
  edits the spec it's judged against outside a confirmed refine.
- **Spec drift detection**: respec loops carry a spec hash, compared
  every tick — external edits ledger `spec_updated` + notify.
- **`spec_item_progress` is now emitted** (was consumed by the stuck
  gate but emitted NOWHERE — a dead signal making the gate look
  stronger than it is): newly checked spec checkboxes emit the event.

669 tests.

## [0.33.1] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — post-release audit batch (three parallel read-only audits)

- **HIGH — control-character injection into the widget**: tool args
  (bash commands, file paths) flowed raw into widget lines — a `\n`
  broke the card into un-prefixed lines that could spoof a footer; an
  ESC sequence corrupted the TUI. `summarizeToolArg` now strips
  C0/C1 control chars and collapses whitespace before truncating.
- **HIGH — `staleTerminalDone` was one-shot for the process lifetime**:
  after a session rebound (switch session instead of /reload), a second
  orphan invalidation hit the done-gate and produced no ledger, no
  interruptedAt marker, and no self-heal — the exact dead-code shape of
  the v0.32.0 CRITICAL, one gate deeper. Reset on rebind.
- **MEDIUM — widget head could exceed terminal width**: the objective
  was budgeted alone and ~45 cols of status segments appended
  unbudgeted (140-col heads at width 100). Segments are measured by
  visible width first; the objective absorbs what remains.
- **MEDIUM — `sendLoopTurn` null-ctx re-arm spun a flat 50ms** below
  every watchdog (the goal path got the v0.32.0 probe + accounting; the
  loop path didn't). Now probes the handle and advances the backoff
  streak.
- **MEDIUM — post-compaction flags leaked across goals/sessions**:
  `postCompactResyncPending`/`postCompactResumeOwed` cleared only by a
  landed send or `agent_start` — a goal that completed after a compact
  left a bogus `[POST-COMPACTION RESYNC]` block and a spurious forced
  refire for the NEXT goal (the heartbeat's discharge `else` was
  unreachable: `isSupervising() ≡ isLoopActive() || isActionableGoal()`).
  Now cleared at goal activation/archival, on session rebind, and by a
  hoisted heartbeat discharge when nothing is supervised.
- **LOW**: resync-builder exceptions no longer masquerade as transport
  failures (guarded, sends without the block); the auditor's abort
  listener is removed in `finally` (session no longer retained by the
  signal); metric loops show `last` again alongside `best`; legacy
  `reviewer` settings key added to provenance; per-goal module state
  (`quotaRetryStreak`, `countedTokenMessages`, `recentActions`) resets
  at activation; in-flight tool map evicts before the 21st entry.

668 tests.

## [0.33.0] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — slim widget card (research-informed redesign)

The above-editor widget is rebuilt on patterns mined from seven CLIs on
a real rig (Codex, Claude Code, Kimi, qwen-code, command-code,
context-mode, cline — full catalog in the commit). Design laws adopted:

- **Status folds into the head line** as middot segments
  (`filter(Boolean).join(" · ")`, the universal idiom):
  `● objective · active · 3m 00s · 1/3 ▰▰▱▱▱ · 12.4k/1000k ▰▱▱▱▱`.
- **5-cell meters with a rounding guard** (command-code's rule: never
  shows empty/full unless truly 0/100%) for task completion and token
  budgets — parse at a glance, correct at any task count.
- **"last action · next task" live line** — Claude's done-row format
  (`✓ edit goal.ts (12s)`) fed by a new tool_call/tool_result ring
  buffer, joined with the next pending task. Failures render `✗`.
- **Slim loop card**: kind-named icon (∞ metricless / ↓↑ metric), iter +
  bounds meter + elapsed + best/stall folded into one header, last-action
  line, hint footer (`metricless (no plateau) · /loop stop · /loop polish`).
- Type visibility law (v0.28.30) kept: list items get a `list item`
  head segment; distinct icons per surface (● ∞ ↓↑ ⟡ ⏸); footers keep
  the type-named verbs.
- Paused/decision cards and the auditor-progress card keep their shape —
  numbered decision options were already best-in-class.

666 tests.

## [0.32.1] — 2026-07-31

### Added — smarter post-compaction recovery (pi-goal-x's lesson)

Field: compactions still dangled the continuation chain (hellhunter's
4-minute dead window; a polis goal sitting stalled after compact+output-
limit turns). The two fixed-offset settle probes (2s, grace+2s) can both
lose if pi is busy at exactly those moments. pi-goal-x handled this
class well — adopted its two core ideas, adapted:

- **Resume debt, not probes.** `session_compact` now arms
  `postCompactResumeOwed`; every heartbeat tick past the grace retries
  the continuation/loop refire until a REAL turn starts (`agent_start`
  discharges it). Ledger: `compaction_resume_owed_refire {kind}`. The
  2s/grace settle probes stay as the fast path.
- **Deterministic `[POST-COMPACTION RESYNC]` block** prepended to the
  first continuation/loop message after a compact: goal id + status,
  objective, next pending task, last audit verdict (or loop target +
  iteration), and "trust artifacts on disk, not memory of the prior
  chat". Consumed only by a landed send (a failed send keeps it armed).

665 tests.

## [0.32.0] — 2026-07-31

Opportunistic plugin audit (three parallel read-only lenses over the
extension) — one CRITICAL, eight smaller fixes.

### Fixed — CRITICAL: orphan-stale recovery was dead code since v0.29.11

`goStaleTerminal` gated on `extensionApiStale`, but the heartbeat's own
staleness PROBE sets that flag on detection — so `probe → terminal`
always bailed on the first line. Orphaned sessions (process alive, pi
handle invalidated) got: no `extension_api_stale` ledger event, no loop
stop, no `interruptedAt`, no warning, and **the v0.29.13/22 self-heal
auto-reload NEVER FIRED** (its only caller is `goStaleTerminal`). Field
proof was hiding in plain sight: hegemon sat stale for days and the
wezterm self-heal never logged once. The terminal path now gates on a
dedicated `staleTerminalDone` flag. The regex-pin tests pinned the call
shape but never executed the ordering — the suite literally pinned the
bug in; the pins now assert the dedicated flag.

### Fixed — audit findings

- **Orphan 50ms spin**: a stale handle with no live ctx re-armed the
  continuation timer at flat 50ms below every watchdog. The no-ctx send
  path now probes staleness and stops; `goStaleTerminal` clears the
  continuation timer.
- **Immortal zombie tickers**: `heartbeatTimer`/`uiTicker` were never
  cleared anywhere (N /reloads = N×2 zombie intervals). Cleared in the
  zombie stand-down.
- **Auditor session leak**: every `complete_goal` leaked one AgentSession
  (never disposed). Now `session.dispose?.()` in the finally.
- **Menu rows lied**: `auditorModelFallback`/`auditorSameSessionSwap`
  were missing from `SETTINGS_KEYS` — pinned values rendered as
  `[default]`. Both keys added.
- **Silent verifier==executor**: the same-session nudge required no
  fallback pin, so the FALLBACK hop landing on the session model stood
  silently — after hop 0's notify claimed "auto-swapped so the verifier
  differs". Now last-pin-guarded; per-pin `via` labels (pins[0] may BE
  the fallback when the primary is unset); duplicate exhaustion notify
  dropped.
- **Quota retry cap**: stored-claim quota retries re-armed forever (a
  dead key = one auditor spawn/hour forever). 5 consecutive → hold,
  loud, `/goal resume` retries by hand.
- **Fan-out cap**: one `/list audit` fan-out caps at 50 queued findings.
- **Entry probe honesty**: the rebind window now says "rebinding — retry
  in a moment" instead of claiming a successor already owns the session.

### Parked (audit's bigger finds, deliberate)

- Cross-process owner liveness (two pi processes on one cwd both pass
  all guards) — needs design, not a patch.
- Ledger JSONL rotation (unbounded growth, whole-file reparse per
  session start).
- `quotaRetryTimer` reload-survival dedupe; `GLLA_AUDITOR=1` env
  sentinel for auditor-spawned bash (v0.31.9's prompt-law stands).

663 tests.

## [0.31.9] — 2026-07-31

### Added — the fork-bomb lesson is now prompt-law

Field incident (2026-07-31): an audit-loop agent wrote a test that ran
`bun test src/lib` from inside src/lib — unbounded recursion, 521
processes, load 28, 24G RAM, a full system crash — and **the isolated
auditor approved it**. Two prompt-law lines, no machinery:

- **Auditor rule 9**: suite-in-suite runner spawns are a reject-class
  pattern; disapprove unless provably depth-capped (e.g. an env
  sentinel). Names the timeout fallacy (kills processes, not depth).
- **Executor hard rule** (goal continuation + both loop prompts):
  "Never run the suite from inside the suite" — count files or parse
  manifests instead.

The agent writing a bad test is the agent's business; the gate
approving it was ours. OS-level blast-radius caps (`ulimit -u`) stay a
rig-level concern, not the extension's.

663 tests.

## [0.31.8] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — the auditor thinking options now come from the PICKED MODEL

User (2026-07-31): "there is still no max setting — we are not using the
model information cause it has no max." The select was a hardcoded ladder
that stopped at xhigh. It now replicates pi's own rule (pi-ai
`getSupportedThinkingLevels`) inline against the picked model at runtime:

- `xhigh`/`max` appear only when the model maps them (`thinkingLevelMap`)
- a level mapped to `null` is hidden
- a non-reasoning model gets NO select — the flow tells you "this model
  exposes no thinking levels (auditor runs with thinking off)" and moves on
- each option carries pi's own description (~1k/~2k/~8k/~32k tokens, max)
- `/glla thinking=` accepts `max`; the settings union includes it

The saved `max` is passed through with a cast — the user's installed pi
(≥0.83) understands it; the extension's older pi-ai dev-types predate it
(which is also why the fields are read at runtime, not imported).

662 tests.

## [0.31.7] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — the auditor-thinking select was indistinguishable from pi's own

User (2026-07-31): "pretty sure we didn't open the model's thinking
setting but a general thinking setting" — confirmed: `auditorModel` saved
but `auditorThinkingLevel` never was; the thinking dialog the user
remembered was pi's GENERAL session-model thinking select, and ours got
Esc'd through as a look-alike. The chained select now:

- titles itself **"Auditor thinking — ISOLATED auditor session ONLY (your
  session model's thinking is untouched)"** — no mistaking which dial it is
- marks the current value `(current)` in the options (default = high)

`max` thinking is NOT offered yet: the extension compiles against its own
pi-ai dev-types which predate `"max"` (pi ≥0.83 has it); offering it would
break compile against older pi. Follows when the dev-types catch up.

661 tests.

## [0.31.6] — 2026-07-31

### Added — Same-model swap toggle (default ON)

User (2026-07-31): "we also need a toggle to decide whether we want to
skip the model if the same as the session model — default can be on." The
diversity trade-off is now explicit, not imposed:

- **`/glla → Same-model swap`** (`auditorSameSessionSwap`, default ON):
  when the pinned auditor IS the session model, walk the fallback pin so
  the verifier differs from the executor. **Off** = same-model audits
  stand, no swap, no nudge — an informed choice, so it stays quiet.
- Either way the FIRST-order defense is untouched: the auditor is always
  an isolated extension-less session with the evidence contract. Diversity
  (independent blind spots — a same-family model shares the executor's
  failure modes when reading its claims) is the second-order layer this
  toggle trades.

661 tests.

## [0.31.5] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — the unset fallback displays as what it is: "session model (last resort)"

User (2026-07-31): "maybe have a def fallback to session." Unset
`auditorModelFallback` was never "none" — the cascade always ends at the
session model. The menu row now says so, and the description spells out
both walk conditions (primary unavailable OR primary == session model).
Display-only; resolution unchanged.

660 tests.

## [0.31.4] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — auditor thinking is chosen WITH the model; the standalone row is gone

User (2026-07-31, looking at the menu): "not sure we want an auditor
thinking option — we are setting the thinking when we select the model now
or we should." A separate thinking row is a dial you can forget to set;
the level is a property OF the model choice.

- `/glla → Auditor model` now chains: pick the model → pick its thinking
  level (high recommended, Esc keeps the current level) → both saved in
  one flow. One confirm line: "Auditor model: X · thinking high".
- The standalone **Auditor thinking** menu row (and its dead case) is
  removed. `/glla thinking=` remains as the direct power path; unset still
  floors at sticky `high` at the call sites.
- Terse value texts per the screenshot review: Auditor model unset shows
  "session model"; fallback unset shows "none".

660 tests.

## [0.31.3] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — the auditor chain replaces "diverse": pinned primary → pinned fallback → session model LAST

User course-correction (2026-07-31): "we might over-complicate this —
complexity cost likely outweighs benefit… it can be the primary auditor and
the session model is always the last; we can have a fallback auditor too.
If the session model is the same as the auditor we auto fallback." The
v0.31.2 diverse strategy (preference table, provider exclusion, per-audit
strategy resolution) is REMOVED after one version — two explicit pins and a
cascade do the same job with a tenth of the machinery.

- **`/glla → Auditor fallback model`** (new pin): walked when the primary
  pin is unavailable OR when the primary IS the session model (the verifier
  must differ from the executor — the auto-swap is loud:
  `auditor_model_same_as_session` + notify).
- **Session model is always the LAST resort**: all pins exhausted → the
  existing loud `auditor_model_fallback` session fallback. Nothing pinned →
  session model, as before. A last-pin == session stands with a one-line
  nudge to wire the swap.
- New `via` values in audit notices: `fallback-pin`, `session-fallback`.
- Kept from 0.31.2: auditor thinking defaults to sticky `high` (never the
  session's coding dial).
- Nothing is pinned for you: set your pair via `/glla → Auditor model` +
  `Auditor fallback model`.

660 tests.

## [0.31.2] — 2026-07-31

### Added — the cross-vendor auditor: `auditorModel: "diverse"` + sticky-high thinking

User design (2026-07-31): "there is benefit to have a different auditor —
M3's auditor could be deepseek and vice versa; and we should select its
thinking level since we don't keep switching it."

- **`/glla → Auditor model → "diverse" (Recommended)`**: each audit picks a
  configured-auth model OUTSIDE the session's provider, fresh per audit —
  session on MiniMax → deepseek via openrouter; session on openrouter →
  MiniMax-M3; then kimi/xai/opencode/zenmux; the session's provider is
  excluded entirely (provider-granularity — openrouter's catalogue is too
  mixed for family-level reasoning). Two independent wins: (1) the auditor
  reads the executor's claims with INDEPENDENT blind spots — same-family
  models share failure modes; (2) audits spend a DIFFERENT provider's quota
  pool — they stop eating the coding session's MiniMax window. No cache
  cost: the auditor is already a fresh extension-less session, so
  cross-vendor shares nothing either way. Nothing outside the session's
  provider → the same LOUD session-fallback as any unavailable configured
  model (`auditor_model_fallback`, never silent — v0.9.12 law).
- **Auditor thinking defaults to sticky `high`** — decoupled from the
  session dial. The bad design the user smelled: unset followed the pi
  session's thinking level, so dialing the session to `low` for fast coding
  silently weakened the verification gate. `getSessionThinkingLevel` is
  gone; `/glla → Auditor thinking` / `/glla thinking=` still overrides.
- Selection is a pure exported function (`pickDiverseAuditorModel` +
  `DIVERSE_AUDITOR_PREFERENCE`) with unit tests on the reciprocal mapping.

661 tests.

## [0.31.1] — 2026-07-31

### Added — audit-initiative stacking guards (junk-runner field confusion)

Field report (2026-07-31, junk-runner): "not sure the goal audit is working
as hoped." The audit WORK was the loop's best field result ever (135 real
bugs closed in 126 iterations — wrong-slot cargo sales, legacy-save crashes,
RNG determinism breaks); the SESSION SURFACE was broken: a `/goal audit`
one-shot launched at 03:57 got held on a reload and sat in the widget for
8h21m ("paused — held for explicit resume") while the older `/loop audit`
did all the visible work. Two stacked audit initiatives, and the agent
conflated them — it proposed calling complete_goal for the loop's work.
Non-destructive guards (warn + ledger `audit_stack_warn`, never block):

- `/loop audit` with a paused/active one-shot audit goal present → "the
  audit loop SUPERSEDES it — /goal cancel clears it; one audit initiative
  per session."
- `/goal audit` while an audit loop is active → "a one-shot duplicates the
  loop's work — /loop status; /loop stop first if you want the one-shot."
- `/list audit` while an audit loop is active → "would double-hunt the same
  ground."
- The restore-hold surface itself now names the supersession: a held
  one-shot audit whose loop is live (active or held) pauses with
  "SUPERSEDED by the audit loop in this session — /goal cancel clears it
  (the loop already owns the audit)" instead of the bare "held for explicit
  resume" that read as stalled for 8 hours.
- Detection via exported markers (GOAL_AUDIT_ONESHOT_MARKER /
  LOOP_AUDIT_MARKER) with unit pins that the built targets still contain
  them — the guards can't silently rot against a target-text edit.

658 tests (the /loop audit pin slice widened past the new guard; the
pauseKind pin window widened past the supersession branch).

## [0.31.0] — 2026-07-31

### Added — /list audit [focus]: the collect-then-drain project audit

User design (2026-07-31): "this command could run a project audit, collect a
bunch of tasks, then do them all too" — and the underlying pain: "my audits
don't seem to be making a list of actionables if found." The three audit
verbs now have an honest split:

- `/goal audit` — one audited unit: audit + fix in the SAME pass (small
  scopes; DECIDE findings presented at completion).
- `/list audit` — audit once, COLLECT only (the item changes no code), then
  every open finding becomes its own queued list item — each fix lands with
  its own commit and its own isolated audit. The actionables stop living
  only inside findings.md.
- `/loop audit` — forever fix-first cadence for living codebases.

- The collection objective carries a restart-safe `[LIST-AUDIT-COLLECT]`
  marker (no schema change); on its approved completion the orchestrator
  parses .pi-glla/audit-loop/findings.md, severity-sorts the open boxes
  (CRITICAL → LOW, stable within a rank), dedupes against the live queue,
  and Confirm-gates the fan-out like every bulk import (v0.23.7). A decline
  leaves the findings open — re-run any time.
- Each queued item carries a checkable Done when: the fix is committed on
  the current branch with the repo's configured identity AND the finding's
  box is checked with the commit hash — findings.md stays honest as the
  drain proceeds.
- DECIDE findings ("- [?]") are presented at collection completion, never
  queued — a decision is not a task the agent can "do".
- Tolerates the /loop audit findings format (open boxes without the FIX:
  prefix are actionable).
- No spurious "List complete" while the fan-out is still Confirm-gated;
  ledgers list_audit_fanout / _declined / _empty.

654 tests (the /loop audit pin now anchors inside cmdLoop — /list audit's
route shadows the first `sub === "audit"` occurrence).

## [0.30.0] — 2026-07-31

### Changed — rebind-first session-replacement survival: no more forced reloads for the common cases

User challenge (2026-07-31): "we don't want to be forced to run reloads —
investigate how others do it; this seems super hacky; no other goal
plugin or coding CLI made me reload." The investigation (pi docs
lifecycle + dist-verified): other plugins never hit staleness because
they don't run an autonomous in-process pump — glla is alone in holding
a send-capable state machine for hours. pi's sanctioned survival pattern
was there all along (`session_shutdown` → cleanup, `session_start` →
re-establish with the NEW ctx; the stale error text itself says to move
post-replacement work into `withSession`). glla treated every stale
handle as terminal ("run /reload") when the three replacement shapes
need three different responses:

- **Switch (resume/new/fork)**: pi rebinds THIS module to the new
  session — `session_start` delivers a fresh ctx. glla now resets the
  stale flag via a re-probe (`stale_flag_reset_on_rebind {stillStale}`),
  claims ownership, and continues silently. No user action, no warning.
  A new 60s rebind window (opened by the `session_shutdown` handler)
  absorbs stale probes that land in the invalidate→rebind gap
  (`stale_awaiting_rebind`) instead of screaming.
- **/reload**: pi re-imports the extension modules — a SUCCESSOR
  instance owns the cwd in the same process. The old module now detects
  the successor via `.pi-glla/owner.json` (`instanceId = pid:startedAt`,
  written on every `session_start`) and STANDS DOWN silently
  (`zombie_stood_down`) — no warning, no /reload injection (v0.29.22's
  self-heal was right for orphans, pure churn here). Stood-down zombies
  never tick again.
- **Orphan**: the session died with NO replacement (hegemon 2026-07-31:
  handle dead ~06:03, zero ledger events for 5h — unattributable then).
  This is the ONLY case that still warns + self-heals
  (goStaleTerminal + v0.29.22's WezTerm/tmux injection).

- New `session_shutdown` handler ledgers pi's `reason`
  (reload/resume/new/fork/quit) — the next unexplained disposal is
  attributable from the ledger alone.
- The entry probe absorbs superseded staleness softly ("a refreshed
  instance owns this session — handled there; nothing to do") instead of
  demanding a reload the fresh instance already made unnecessary.

644 tests (the decide-picker test now rewrites the last STATE ledger
entry in place — session_start ledgering made last-line ≠ last-state).

## [0.29.23] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — wedge-class pause guidance is Escape/reload-first, not restart-first (the "retry storm" note)

Field (junk-runner + pully 2026-07-31, user note: "retry storm is another
one"): the send-retry-storm and stall-escalation pauses still said
"Restart pi, then /goal resume" — the v0.29.12 /reload-first mandate had
only reached the stale-handle paths. Worse, restart-first was the WRONG
verb for the common wedge shape: pi's own provider retry loop
("Retrying (13/15) in 2875s… escape to cancel") holds the session busy
so the continuation can never land — the correct first move is Escape
(pi cancels its wedged run), not a restart.

- Send-retry storm (goal + loop), stall escalation (goal + loop),
  audit-lifecycle storm notice, stale-goal-save, drafting-seed-stale,
  and postaudit-proposal-undelivered surfaces all now say: Escape
  cancels the stuck run → /goal resume or /loop resume → /reload if it
  persists → restart pi only if /reload itself fails.
- Every remaining "Restart pi" in the extension is the conditional
  "only if /reload fails" form.

643 tests.

## [0.29.22] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — the stale-handle self-heal actually fires on this rig (WezTerm), and can no longer kill work

Field (polis + hegemon 2026-07-31, user: "stopping and told to reload is
common — investigate the cause"): the v0.29.13 tmux self-heal had NEVER
fired fleet-wide (`auto_reload_injected` absent from every ledger) —
this rig runs **WezTerm** (`TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm`, `WEZTERM_PANE` set, no
`TMUX`), so the tmux gate failed silently 100% of the time and every
stale handle fell back to the manual warning. Root cause of the
staleness itself, pi-dist-verified: `session.dispose()` (the only
invalidator) fires on /reload, /resume, /new, /fork, /quit — i.e. the
fleet's own /reload maintenance rounds; compaction is in-place and never
disposes (the stale-after-compact sightings are detection timing: the
post-compact heartbeat is just the first glla activity that notices).

- `attemptTmuxAutoReload` → `attemptAutoReload`: tmux transport kept,
  WezTerm transport added (`wezterm cli send-text --pane-id $WEZTERM_PANE
  --no-paste '/reload\r'` — /bin/sh-safe, no bash-isms). Ledger
  `auto_reload_injected {where, transport, pane}`; a no-multiplexer env
  ledgers `auto_reload_skipped` instead of failing silently.
- **Non-destructive by design** (user pushback: "the operation kills the
  session"): the leading Escape keystroke is GONE from both transports —
  a late zombie probe can fire after a fresh instance already resumed
  and started a turn, and Escape would abort that turn without consent.
  /reload alone lands at a dead prompt and queues harmlessly mid-turn
  (pi refuses the reload itself while streaming).
- The entry probe deliberately does NOT self-heal: it fires when the
  user is actively typing a /glla command, and injected keystrokes would
  race their input. User-present cases keep the manual warning.
- External notify on stale now says "/reload, then /glla resume" (the
  old "restart pi" text predated v0.29.12).

643 tests.

## [0.29.21] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — post-compaction recovery no longer waits on the heartbeat's phase

Field (hellhunter 2026-07-31, user: "we def have compaction related
stoppage"): two output-token-limit turns → auto-compaction at 195.8k →
**zero continuation rearm attempts after the compact event** → ~4 minutes
that read as a stoppage; recovery came only at 04:34:48 via the first
post-grace heartbeat tick (the user's /glla resume prods landed seconds
earlier and looked like the fix). The compaction WAS an accomplice, via
pi's no-agent_end-on-compact, but the machinery recovered inside its
designed tolerances — the grace (3 min) + heartbeat interval just made
the dead window look permanent.

- The `session_compact` handler now arms a SECOND settle refire at grace
  expiry (`COMPACTION_GRACE_MS + 2s`), same guards as the 2s settle
  (idle, no pending, no timers, supervising, not stood-down). The 2s
  settle almost always loses (pi is mid-compact / mid-resumed-turn then);
  the grace-expiry settle fires the moment the machinery un-suppresses
  instead of landing up to one heartbeat interval late. Ledger
  `compaction_grace_refire`.
- Not a bug, confirmed while here: the output-token-limit turns
  ("Model stopped because it reached the maximum output token limit")
  are handled by v0.27.2 length-continue (re-issue with split-smaller
  guidance, loud give-up after 3 consecutive). Under ~196k context
  MiniMax-M3 emits multi-thousand-line edit payloads that hit the
  per-response cap — model-side behavior, not a glla wedge.

641 tests.

## [0.29.20] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — plain plateau stops are resumable

The v0.29.19 resumable classes covered the new stop reasons but not the
plain `plateau — no improvement …` stop — which is exactly what the two
pre-gate false plateaus carry (hegemon best 74 / 13 open, polis best 46 /
3+ open, 2026-07-31). `/loop resume` now accepts any plateau stop: with
the stall window re-armed, reprieves fresh, and the audit plateau gate
live, a resumed false plateau runs honestly and a resumed dry well just
re-plateaus.

640 tests.

## [0.29.19] — 2026-07-31

### Fixed — dead turns no longer kill loops (provider-error exemption everywhere) + audit plateau gate

Field (2026-07-31, overnight MiniMax token-plan 429 storm): every fleet
loop died on DEAD turns, not on the work. The v0.28.13/v0.29.4 exemptions
only covered the goal nudge counter — the loop's own accounting counted
429 corpses: hegemon plateau-stopped at best 74 with **13 open findings**,
polis at best 46 with 3+, hellhunter stuck-stopped at iter 93 on
"narration only" turns that were really error turns.

- **Error/abort turns are not iterations**: `agent_end` with stopReason
  `error`/`aborted` now skips the loop's measure + stuck + stall accounting
  entirely and refires (ledger `loop_turn_exempt_error`). Bounded: 6
  consecutive error turns stop the loop with the honest
  `provider errors — 6 consecutive error turns (iteration N preserved)`;
  3 consecutive user aborts stop it with `stopped by user —` (user aborts
  mean STOP). Both resumable via `/loop resume`.
- **Audit plateau gate**: an audit loop's plateau stop now only fires when
  the well is ACTUALLY dry (orchestrator counts open `- [ ]` boxes in
  findings.md). Plateauing with open findings stands the stop down
  (`audit_plateau_reprieve`), resets the stall, and shoves the next
  iteration with "K findings still OPEN — close one NOW". Bounded by 2
  reprieves; the third plateau stops with the honest
  `no closure in W×3 iterations despite K open findings` (resumable).
- **`/loop resume` generalised**: held, provider-error, user-abort,
  blocked-plateau, and stuck-ladder stops are all resumable; an explicit
  resume re-arms the counters (stall window, dead-turn/stuck streaks,
  reprieves) — the user saying "push again" wins over the ladder's memory.
- Test harness: MockPi exec is now programmable per-test; new
  `__testOnlyResetOwnerSession` releases the session-owner claim between
  test files.

639 tests.

## [0.29.18] — 2026-07-30

### Changed — /loop audit is now FIX-FIRST (re-audit on cadence, not every iteration)

Field (hegemon iter 26, 2026-07-30): the audit-every-iteration target
made discovery (8-12 findings/iter) outpace fixes (1/iter) — the open
backlog grew while the visible output read as "find things and present
them". Worse, the agent burned a whole iteration on "no new action this
turn" with 18 open boxes. User: "the goal would be audit to fix then
audit then fix again no?"

- New target order: (1) FIX the highest-severity OPEN finding(s) every
  iteration — an iteration that closes nothing while open boxes exist is
  a wasted iteration ("no new action this turn" is explicitly
  unacceptable; blocked → name the blocker, work the first unblocked
  one). (2) RE-AUDIT on cadence: fresh pass with Explore fan-out ONLY
  when no open findings remain, ~10 iterations since the last pass, or
  your own fixes plausibly broke something. (3) append findings,
  (4) honesty law — unchanged, as is the closed-count/max metric.
- Live-loop migration on load: audit loops still carrying the
  audit-every-iteration target get the fix-first target swapped in
  (ledger `audit_loop_target_migrated`); best/stall survive — the
  metric is unchanged.

633 tests.

## [0.29.17] — 2026-07-30

### Added — /model-style fuzzy picker for model settings + loud session-model fallback

Field: the auditor ran on `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` (set
globally by an AI session weeks ago) until the OpenRouter key hit its
TOTAL limit — every audit fleet-wide 403'd into quota parks. Fixing it
meant hand-typing provider/model into a bare `ctx.ui.input`, and the
user asked for the /model interaction shape instead.

- New `ModelPickerComponent` (extensions/model-picker.ts): search line +
  fuzzy-filtered list (pi-tui `fuzzyFilter`), hosted via `ctx.ui.custom`
  like the v0.28.0 settings table. Items: "session model — clear the
  override" first, every configured-auth model sorted by provider/id,
  "type manually…" escape hatch last. Models come from
  `ctx.modelRegistry.getAvailable()` filtered by `hasConfiguredAuth` —
  a pick from this list can never be a dead provider.
- Wired into the settings menu for **Auditor model** and the three
  **subagent model pins** (Explore / Plan / general-purpose). Headless
  runtimes (no `ctx.ui.custom`) keep the typed input as the hatch.
- **Fallback**: a configured `auditorModel` that is unavailable (unknown
  id, or provider with no configured auth) now falls back LOUDLY to the
  session model — warning notify + `auditor_model_fallback` ledger —
  instead of hard-failing the audit. The v0.9.12 no-SILENT-substitution
  law stands; quota-exhausted keys stay on the quota-retry path (the
  model is available there, the key's window is the failure).

632 tests.

## [0.29.16] — 2026-07-30

### Added — zombie-run watchdog: busy-but-silent = hung provider stream

Field (hellhunter + hegemon, 2026-07-30): MiniMax streams died silently —
no error, no timeout, and pi has no read timeout, so `_isAgentRunActive`
stayed true forever. Every continuation queued into the void (sends
resolve, nothing reaches the session log), and the busy flag concealed
the wedge from EVERY existing watchdog: the heartbeat refire needs idle,
the latch watchdog needs a glla-side timer, the stall counter needs
refires. Both loops sat frozen with state intact and zero alerts.

- New stream-liveness clock fed ONLY by genuine pi events
  (message_update / tool_call / agent_start / turn_start / agent_end) —
  heartbeat-internal bookkeeping never touches it.
- Supervising + pi reports busy + zero stream events for 20 min → loud
  `zombie_run_suspected` warning: the provider stream is hung, press Esc
  to abort the zombie turn — the heartbeat refires the goal/loop itself.
  Throttled to one alert per 10 min.
- Detection + guidance only: aborting a turn is the user's call (consent
  line). Auto-abort stays parked until the false-positive rate is known.

625 tests.

## [0.29.15] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — the audit-loop widget names its metric instead of showing raw shell

Field (user, twice): "we are still seeing that weird line" — the loop
widget's fourth line rendered the audit measure verbatim
(`c=$(grep -cE '^- \[[xX]\]' … 2>/dev/null); echo ${c:-0}`), shell
escapes and all. For an orchestrator-owned measure that's leaked
internals, not information. kind:"audit" loops now show
`metric: closed findings ('- [x]' count)`; user-authored measures
(/loop start measure="…") still show raw — there the command IS the
user's own spec.

624 tests.

## [0.29.14] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — audit-loop metric no longer punishes discovery (closed-count/max)

Field (user's session): iteration 6 ran a fresh audit, found 11 genuinely
new real issues AND closed a CRITICAL — and the metric read 27→38→37 as
regression (best 20, stall 4/5, one discovery iteration from a plateau
stop mid-work). The open-findings count/min metric treated DISCOVERY —
the loop's core job — as regressing.

- The audit measure now counts CLOSED findings (`- [x]`), direction=max.
  Closed-count is monotonic under the honesty law (a checked box requires
  a fix commit): discovery alone doesn't move the metric, landing fixes
  does. Iteration 6 above scores +1 = improvement = stall reset.
- The plateau stop now fires only when NO FIXES LAND for the window —
  the honest dry-well, replacing the "audits stop surfacing new findings"
  proxy that confused finding work with regressing.
- Live/held audit loops migrate on session load: old open-count/min
  measure → closed-count/max, pinned best nulled (next measure is the
  honest baseline), stall streak reset. `audit_loop_metric_migrated`
  ledgered; supersedes the v0.29.10 baseline-0 reseed.
- The regression note matches the new semantics: a true regression is the
  closed count going DOWN = a reopened finding or a rewritten findings.md
  (both forbidden) — never "you found new problems".

623 tests.

## [0.29.13] — 2026-07-30

### Added — stale-handle AUTO-RECOVERY: tmux keystroke self-heal

User ask: "can we make it automatic" — pi walls every runtime method
(`sendUserMessage`, `getSessionName`, even `ctx.reload()`) behind
`assertActive()`, so a disposed-session zombie cannot recover through
pi's API. But fs/child_process are extension-side and keep working.

- On the stale terminal, when pi runs inside tmux (`$TMUX` + a
  shape-validated `$TMUX_PANE`), glla injects `/reload` as keystrokes
  into its own pane (`tmux send-keys … -l '/reload' … Enter`). Pi
  rebuilds the extension runtime in place; the fresh instance loads
  .pi-glla state and holds — `/glla resume` continues (fully hands-off
  with autoresume=on). `auto_reload_injected` ledgered.
- Outside tmux nothing changes: the manual `/reload` warning stands.
- Opt out per project or globally: `autoReloadOnStale: false`.

622 tests.

## [0.29.12] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — stale-handle recovery is /reload-first (no pi restart), and /glla resume is zombie-aware

User pushback + a pi 0.83.0 source audit settled two things:

- **Compaction never invalidates the extension handle.** Verified in pi
  dist: the only `invalidate()` caller is `AgentSession.dispose()`,
  reachable solely via session replacement (new/switch/fork/quit);
  manual, auto, and overflow compaction all rebuild context in place.
  The v0.28.1-era "compaction triggers it" claim was correlation — field
  forensics (endless-td: 10 stale events in 4 days, repeatedly ~3 min
  after compactions with no new session file and zombie command handlers
  still answering) point at a pi-side replacement that disposes without
  re-running factories. Reportable upstream.
- **/reload recovers in place.** It rebuilds the extension runtime in
  the same process — the fresh instance loads .pi-glla state and holds.
  Recovery is `/reload`, then `/glla resume`; a full pi restart is only
  the fallback if /reload itself fails. The terminal guidance, the
  entry-probe warning, and the interrupted footer all now say so.

- **`/glla resume` probes staleness at entry.** Field (endless-td): the
  zombie instance answered with a misleading "Nothing to resume". It now
  names the real recovery instead.

621 tests.

## [0.29.11] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — stale-handle sessions: probe before refiring, hold loops for resume, and recovery text that names the real verbs

Field evidence (polis + endless-td 2026-07-30): compaction replaced the
session (pi 0.82.x invalidates the extension handle), and the heartbeat
burned stall refires into the dead process (stall 3/5, stall 1/5) before
a send happened to throw and trip the terminal warning. The warning then
said "loops need /loop start" — discarding iteration/best/history — and
the footer promised "auto-resumes on pi restart", which is only true
with autoresume=on (hold-everything is the default).

- **Heartbeat probes staleness first**: the first tick after session
  replacement calls the side-effect-free staleness probe and goes
  terminal immediately — no more refires into the void racing the
  terminal detector.
- **Stale/stalled/storm-stopped loops HOLD on next load**: stopReasons
  from the stale terminal, the stall escalation, and the send-rearm
  storm now become HELD_ON_RESTORE on session load — `/loop resume`
  continues from saved state (iteration/best/history intact) instead of
  restarting from scratch. `loop_held_for_resume` ledgered.
- **Recovery text names the real verbs**: guidance, entry-probe warning,
  footer, stall and storm notifications all now say "restart pi, then
  /glla resume (autoresume=on resumes for you)" / "→ /loop resume (the
  loop holds on restore)" instead of promising auto-resume or demanding
  /loop start.

620 tests.

## [0.29.10] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — the audit loop's degenerate baseline stalled every iteration and the prompt cried REGRESSED on real progress

Field evidence (hegemon + junk-runner 2026-07-30): `/loop audit` seeded
`bestValue` from a pre-discovery baseline of **0** (no findings file yet).
Since improvement requires beating best and no count can go below 0,
*every* iteration stalled — the loop would plateau-stop mid-work at the
window — and the regression note fired on any non-improving iteration:
junk-runner's agent correctly closed a finding (17→16) and the prompt
demanded **"Your last change REGRESSED the metric. Undo it first."** The
agent refused ("I'll trust the file"); a less stubborn one would have
reverted good work.

- **Deferred baseline** (`deferBaseline`): the audit loop no longer seeds
  best from the pre-work measure — the first REAL measurement (post-
  discovery) becomes the baseline. Discovery is not a stall, fixing beats
  best honestly, and flat zeros at the dry well still plateau-stop.
- **True-regression detection**: the REGRESSED note now fires only when
  the last two measurements actually moved the wrong direction — a stall
  is not a regression. Audit loops get their own wording: a rising count
  means new findings or an unlanded fix, keep fixing highest-severity OPEN.
- **Live-loop migration**: on session load, an audit loop pinned on the
  degenerate 0 is reseeded (`bestValue → null`, stall reset,
  `audit_loop_baseline_reseeded` ledgered) — junk-runner's running loop
  heals on its next pi restart, no wipe needed.

618 tests.

## [0.29.9] — 2026-07-30

### Changed — the error-brake park now probes at the top of each hour

Field evidence (pully 2026-07-30): a MiniMax token-plan 429 wall produced
six brake cycles in ~30m, then the v0.29.1 cap parked the goal with "no
more auto-retries" — dead until a human noticed, even though coding-plan
rate-limit windows typically expire on clock-hour boundaries.

User design (2026-07-30): "we are simply adding an hourly retry — just to
pick up work faster assuming the retry expired or would take long to
resume." The park now schedules a probe for the **next top-of-hour + 60s
grace**: if the window has opened, the resume sails through and the whole
error cycle resets; if not, one free dunk (429s are rejected pre-billing)
and the brake re-parks with the next hourly probe. One transcript line per
hour, no classification machinery, pi's own retry config irrelevant —
stock 5-retry users get the full gain.

The probe only fires while the goal is *still* error-parked
(`pauseKind: "error"` + the brake-cap reason) — user pauses, resumes,
cancels, and completions are never stomped. Ledger: `hourly_rate_probe`,
`goal_resumed via: "hourly-rate-probe"`.

616 tests.

## [0.29.8] — 2026-07-30

### Added — `/goal audit [focus]`: the one-shot project audit; `/glla status`: the unified view

User design session (2026-07-30): "/loop audit keeps firing — this would
be fire and address what you can, present what is to be decided; whether
to fix a bug is not a decision." And on naming: "/goal audit IS the audit
goal — we are not auditing the current goal, that happens automatically."

**`/goal audit [focus]`** starts a one-shot project-audit GOAL (a loop is
the wrong vehicle — this has a finish line the isolated auditor verifies):

- One fresh audit pass (Explore fan-out for breadth); new findings go to
  the same `.pi-glla/audit-loop/findings.md` the audit loop uses — one
  findings ledger per project.
- **The triage law**: `FIX` findings (bugs, polish — nobody would say
  "leave that bug in") are fixed autonomously, committed, checked off.
  `DECIDE` findings (`- [?]` lines — direction, trade-offs, scope; two
  reasonable answers exist) are presented in the completion report and
  NEVER touched — and never inflate the loop's open-findings measure.
- Explicit Done-when: pass complete · every new FIX finding has its fix
  commit and a checked box · DECIDE findings listed and presented.

**Rename**: the v0.28.27 manual current-goal auditor trigger moves from
`/goal audit` to **`/goal verify`** ("the work looks done — just verify
it"). Completion audits were always automatic; this is the on-demand
handle. Same pendingCompletion machinery, same ledger event.

**`/glla status`** — the unified what's-running view (user: "now we need
to type goal status [to check] — that command at least is missing for
checking on whatever active process we have"). One read-only aggregate:
goal (policy/status/tokens/pause reason) · list queue + head · loop
(active/held, iteration, best, stall) · pending decision pointer —
plus pointers to the deep surfaces.

614 tests.

## [0.29.7] — 2026-07-30

### Changed — docs cleanup (README, DESIGN, INSTALL, PLAN)

Docs had drifted across the v0.28–v0.29 hardening arc; brought back in
line with shipped behavior:

- **README**: `/glla wipe` in the command map; `autoResume` documented as
  **global-only** (v0.29.5) with the resolution carve-out; auto-accepted
  drafts **start immediately** (v0.29.4 decoupling — "pair with
  autoresume" advice replaced by the attended-rig sweet spot); new
  "One active thing (auto-arbitrated)" section (v0.29.6); self-watchdog
  section covers stranded-audit recovery, storm rearm/brake, and the
  user-abort stand-down; garbled `autoaccept` config line fixed; test
  count 545 → 613.
- **docs/DESIGN.md**: new "Addendum v0.5.0–v0.29.6 (current state)"
  summarizing the shape-changing decisions of the long-session era
  (restore gate, draft/restore decoupling, abort stand-down, auto-
  arbitration, completion-lifecycle pause ownership, `/loop audit` as the
  project reviewer, git-discipline prompt-law).
- **INSTALL.md**: aggressive-mode table notes autoResume is global-only.
- **PLAN.md**: header points at CHANGELOG + the DESIGN addendum as the
  canonical current record.

No behavior changes.

## [0.29.6] — 2026-07-30

### Changed — stacked states AUTO-ARBITRATE at session load (the picker is gone)

User directive: "auto archive / wipe extra goals/loops/lists … make sure
that we only have one". Dirty pre-guard states can persist a live loop
AND a live goal (darklord/hegemon/pully field cases); the 0.28.21
decision picker asked the user to arbitrate artifacts they didn't
remember at every pi start, and 0.29.3 added a wipe escape to it. Now
deterministic — no picker at all:

- **Most recent activity keeps the slot** (goal `updatedAt` vs the loop's
  last measure/`startedAt`; ties keep the loop, the 0.28.21 default).
- **The loser is ARCHIVED, never wiped** — goals go through the standard
  archive path (`.pi-glla/archive/*.md` + `goal_archived` ledger); loops
  stop in place with an honest `stopReason` (visible in `/loop status`).
  Ledger: `stacked_state_auto_arbitrated {kept, goalMs, loopMs, …}`.
- The notify names the recoveries: `/loop status` · `.pi-glla/archive/` ·
  `/glla wipe` for a full clean slate.
- **The queued list is a backlog, not a live artifact — untouched.**

Arbitration runs BEFORE the restore gate, so the survivor then follows
the normal hold-vs-resume policy. The one-active-thing guards (pause a
goal → start a loop → /goal resume refuses) are untouched for in-session
combos. Behavioral pins rewritten: both arbitration branches (loop-newer
→ goal archived; goal-newer → loop stopped) + the guard-source pin.
613 tests.

## [0.29.5] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — the stand-down survives the heartbeat; autoResume is GLOBAL-only

Two follow-ups from the first field run of 0.29.4 (junk-runner launch,
2026-07-30):

1. **The stand-down flag.** The 0.29.4 abort stand-down left the goal
   ACTIVE with no timer — exactly the heartbeat refire's trigger shape
   (`isSupervising + idle + no timer + 60s quiet`), so the chain would
   have re-fired under the user's hands within a minute. New module-level
   `abortedStandDown`: set by the abort stand-down, gates the heartbeat
   refire AND the post-compaction refire, cleared by any explicit
   `scheduleContinuation` (resume/activate/next turn).
2. **autoResume reads are global-only** (user directive: "we are not
   supporting project level setting for it now, just global"). The
   junk-runner launch auto-fired because a stale PROJECT-LOCAL
   `.pi-glla/settings.json` (`autoResume: true` from the unattended-audit
   era) overrode the freshly-flipped global default. New
   `loadGlobalSettings()`; the session-restore gate and the reviewer
   enqueue gate read it exclusively — project-level `autoResume` keys are
   now inert. Restore-hold hint strings updated ("global setting", was
   "in this project").

Behavioral tests that opted into autoresume via the project file now
write the harness global settings path (with `afterEach` cleanup — module
state is process-wide). Pins: 1 consolidated test. 613 tests.

## [0.29.4] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — the Esc-spam loop: user aborts stand the chain down and never count toward stalls

Pully field case (2026-07-30): a bare `pi` launch auto-fired the queued
list, the user pressed Esc — and EVERY abort was answered by a fresh
continuation under their hands (the aborted branch fell through to
`scheduleContinuation`), while each aborted turn ALSO counted as an
"unproductive turn" → STALL WARNING 1/3, 2/3 → a bogus "stalled" pause
punishing the user's own interrupt. Two changes:

1. **Aborted turns are exempt from the stall accounting** (same shape as
   the 0.28.13 provider-error exemption — ledger
   `stall_nudge_exempt_aborted`; neither increment nor reset).
2. **An abort stands the chain DOWN** — no auto re-fire. Notify: "standing
   down — turn aborted by user (not counted toward stalls). /goal resume
   to continue, /goal cancel to stop." The 5-consecutive-aborts loud pause
   remains as the backstop (now reached only via resume→abort cycles).

### Changed — autoResume decoupled from draft starts (it gates launch-time restore ONLY)

The same launch fired because the global `autoResume: true` (set for the
held-draft complaint) also governs session-restore — resurrecting queued
work at every bare `pi` start ("the session auto starts in some cases …
launching pi with an active goal auto triggered"). The semantics are now
split the way the user actually means them:

- **Auto-accepted drafts START** (supersedes the 0.28.28 hold):
  `autoAcceptDrafts` is the pre-consent for drafts the user asks for
  in-session. The 0.29.1 zombie-twin guard refuses duplicates of
  just-completed work upstream, so starting is safe. `draft_held` is gone.
- **`autoResume` gates ONLY launch-time restore** of persisted state
  ("load it but not auto start it", 0.28.21) — per-project opt-in for
  unattended rigs. Global setting flipped back to `false`; the in-session
  chain (compaction/reload/fork) still auto-continues.

Pins: 1 consolidated abort test + the draft-hold pin inverted (0.28.28 →
0.29.4). 612 tests.

## [0.29.3] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — empty allowlist warning; the session-load arbitration offers the wipe escape

Field report (darklord, at bare `pi` start): "older projects may have
multiple goals/loops/lists instead of one total overall … getting this in
pi start … i feel like wipe does [make sense]".

1. **No more `glla: 0 agent tool(s) were hidden … re-activated ()`.** The
   v0.24.5 tool-heal notify fired unconditionally once per session, even
   when nothing was missing. It now warns only on a real heal
   (`missing.length > 0`).

2. **Wipe is now an option in the loop-vs-goal arbitration picker.** The
   v0.28.21 session-load guard pauses the goal with a two-option decision
   when a dirty legacy state has both an active goal and a loop — but for
   pre-guard stacked leftovers, arbitrating between two artifacts the user
   doesn't remember was the odd part. Third option added: "Wipe everything
   — clean slate for stale leftovers (/glla wipe)". The decision prompt
   executes it via `cmdGllaWipe`, which keeps its own Confirm listing
   exactly what goes (goal archived as aborted, list cleared, loop
   stopped) — destructive actions keep their gate; history stays in
   `.pi-glla`.

Pin: 1 consolidated test (notify guard, option text, wipe dispatch).
611 tests.

## [0.29.2] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — git discipline law: agents stop inventing identities and branches

Field-observed 2026-07-30: the hellhunter Phase-E agent branded itself
`phase-e-agent <phase-e@local>` on main-history commits (via per-commit
identity overrides), and several other projects gained invented LOCAL git
configs (`darklord-dev <darklord@dracon.local>`, `dracon <dracon@local>`)
while the global identity was correct all along. The prompts simply never
said not to. Now every execution prompt carries the law:

- `goal-loop-continuation.md` HARD RULES: commit with the repo's
  configured identity exactly as-is — no `git config user.*`, no per-commit
  `-c user.name=…` overrides, no `<task>-agent <…@local>` inventions; no
  creating/switching branches (commit on the branch you found, push to its
  upstream); if git refuses for a missing identity, STOP and ask the user.
- `goal-loop-forever.md` / `goal-loop-forever-metricless.md` hard rules:
  same law, loop-phrased.
- `/loop audit`'s target honesty laws: fix commits land with the repo's
  configured identity on the current branch.

Pin: 1 consolidated test across all three prompts + the audit target.
610 tests.

## [0.29.1] — 2026-07-30

### Fixed — the completion lifecycle survives the wedged-queue window (the "complete ending in a pause retry storm" class, field-observed in THREE projects in one day)

Incident triage across junk-runner, hellhunter, and pully ledgers
(2026-07-29/30): goals whose work was DONE — auditor-approved, commits
pushed — kept ending up paused with "send-retry storm" cards, stranded for
3–12h. Three holes, one root window (provider errors + wedged send queue
while the isolated auditor runs its minutes-long pass):

1. **Storm escalation no longer pauses the audit lifecycle.** An isolated
   auditor run takes minutes and the main session is EXPECTED silent
   during it — 15m of wedged re-arms + that silence was the storm
   detector's exact trigger shape, so completing a goal under a wedged
   queue guaranteed a mid-audit pause. `escalateSendRearmStorm` now
   suppresses the pause when status is `auditing`, an audit is in flight,
   or a completion claim is stored (ledger:
   `send_rearm_escalated_suppressed`); the audit lifecycle's own pauses
   (quota etc.) still work.

2. **Stranded-audit watchdog.** A goal left `auditing` with no in-flight
   audit means the auditor's result never landed (pully: 12h+ stuck while
   the model had already confabulated the closure). The heartbeat now
   recovers after 90s: a stored claim re-runs the auditor DIRECTLY (no
   agent turn); otherwise the goal resumes active so the agent re-calls
   `complete_goal`. Ledger: `stranded_audit_recovered`.

3. **Error-brake cycle cap.** The v0.28.25 escalating ladder (1m→16m)
   slowed the pause↔error-brake-retry thrash but never stopped it — all
   three ledgers show 4+ cycles against provider windows lasting hours.
   After 6 consecutive brakes the goal now PARKS (no more auto-retries)
   with a loud "check the provider, then /goal resume" card. Ledger:
   `error_brake_capped`.

### Fixed — zombie-twin guard (duplicate of just-completed work can't be drafted or enqueued)

Junk-runner: the INFRA-NEW-18 close was re-drafted as a list item THREE
MINUTES after the auditor approved it; `autoaccept=on` waved the twin
straight in, where it stormed for 9h against a dead provider — while the
user believed the work was closed. Now: `goal_archived` ledger entries
carry the objective (retro fallback parses the archived file's
`## Objective`), and both the draft path (auto-accepted OR confirmed — the
Confirm dialog never said it was a duplicate) and `enqueueItems` refuse
objectives that normalized-match a goal completed within 24h. Loud, never
silent: `draft_duplicate_skipped` / `list_duplicate_skipped` + a warning
naming the completed work.

Terminology note (user decision): `/loop audit` stays a /loop subcommand —
"not a different function type", just a loop with an honest metric and a
plateau stop.

Pins: 2 new consolidated tests (storm suppression ordering, stranded
watchdog ordering, brake cap, guard sites). 609 tests.

## [0.29.0] — 2026-07-29

### Added — `/loop audit`: the project-audit loop (the reviewer's reflexive scan is now opt-in)

User design session (2026-07-29): "the reviewer is not a reviewer of work
happened but a reviewer of the PROJECT … if we are already firing an audit
all the way through then does the final audit make sense separately? … the
best for this would be the looper — running audits to see where to
progress and what to fix."

**The architecture that makes sense** (user-approved):

1. **Auditor = work verifier** — per completion, all the way through.
   Unchanged; this is the verification spine.
2. **Reviewer = project strategist** — holes, next steps, drift. The
   reflexive `fire-audit-on-clean` cascade step is REMOVED from the
   default config: the auditor already verified the work, so re-firing a
   regression scan after every clean completion paid for verification
   twice (and was hydra fuel — scan goals spawning scan proposals). The
   step still exists for rigs that opt into it explicitly; the duplicate-
   scan dedupe and E4 delivery-gating behavior are pinned with it
   explicitly enabled.
3. **Project audit = the looper's job** — `/loop audit`:

   - Each iteration runs a FRESH audit pass (Explore subagents for
     breadth), appends every NEW finding as a checkbox line to
     `.pi-glla/audit-loop/findings.md` (append-only; never rewrite
     history), fixes the highest-severity open finding(s), and checks
     them off with the fix commit.
   - **It is a METRIC loop** — the one thing respec (metricless) and the
     reviewer cascade (no termination) both lacked: the orchestrator
     counts open findings (`grep -c '^- [ ]'`, single number in every
     file state — verified), direction=min, and the **plateau stop is
     the termination**: audits that stop surfacing new findings = the
     well is dry = the loop ends. No doorknob-polishing.
   - Honesty laws in the target: never fabricate findings to look busy;
     never check a box without the fix commit existing.
   - Same start rules as respec: typed command = the act; refuses to
     stack over an active goal or loop.

4. **List-drain pointer**: when a list's last item completes and the
   queue empties, the completion path now suggests `/loop audit` — a
   suggestion, never an auto-start (consent per v0.28.28).

Pins: routing + guards + drain suggestion; measure/target/file constants;
target honesty laws; reviewer default cascade without the step (opt-in
behavior tests explicitly enable it). 607 tests.

## [0.28.34] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — notify folds a default IN; README decouples from the tintinweb eco

User: "we are too married to our own eco … leaving notify setup to the
user sucks, cause then they won't have it" and "i removed pi-tasks — our
list is our tasklist, the todos were the weaker copy".

- **Push notifications work out of the box.** `notifyCmd` unset no longer
  means silent: glla auto-detects `notify-send` (Linux) or `osascript`
  (macOS) once per session and pushes through it. `notify=off` is the
  explicit opt-out; `notify='<cmd>'` stays the custom override. Pushes
  still fire only where there is something to DO — pauses, auditor
  verdicts, storms, wedge, persistence degradation — never per-turn
  noise. The settings row reads "auto" when unset.
- **README decoupled.** "Subagents (`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`)" →
  "Subagents": the guarantees come from glla's session-handle
  discrimination, not any plugin; tintinweb is "the one we test against",
  not a requirement. Compatibility list names "any subagent provider".
- **pi-tasks reframed as overlap, not complement** — "Overlaps — pick
  one": the glla `/list` IS the task list; two task lists is not the
  ideal combo. (The author's rig uninstalled it the same day.)

Pins: resolution order (off → custom → auto), probe command, both
notifier command lines, actionable-only comment, settings-row text,
README retitle + decoupling + notify footnote. 606 tests.

## [0.28.33] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — `/glla reset` renamed to `/glla wipe`

User catch, same day the command shipped: "reset" sits at edit-distance
2 from "resume" in the same namespace, and it's the destructive one —
the Confirm dialog catches a fat-finger, but the hazard class shouldn't
exist. Renamed before any muscle memory formed:

- **`/glla wipe`** is the one-shot clean slate (unchanged behavior:
  confirm gate, honest goal archive, list cleared, loop stopped,
  `glla_wipe` ledger event).
- **`/glla reset`** now prints "renamed to /glla wipe … Nothing was
  done." and does NOT execute — the ambiguous word can never act.

## [0.28.32] — 2026-07-29

### Added — `/glla resume` + `/glla cancel`: type-blind verbs over the ONE live thing

User: "would it make sense to bundle resume and cancel into /glla so we
don't have to check what type we are running — but this sucks if we need
different commands or one command doesn't work for others." The split:

- **Unified:** `resume` and `cancel` — their meaning is type-independent.
  `/glla resume` resumes whatever is paused (goal or list item) or held
  (loop); `/glla cancel` cancels the one live thing uniformly — goal/list
  item archived as aborted, active or held loop stopped. Same outcome
  shape regardless of the hidden type.
- **Kept typed:** tweak/finish/next/decide/refine genuinely differ per
  policy — folding them in is the trap the user named. `/list cancel`
  (item + drop queue) and `/glla reset` (nuke all) remain the power verbs.

Safe because one-active-thing is enforced (v0.28.14+): at most one thing
is ACTIVE, so the only real ambiguity is paused-goal + held-loop
coexisting (nothing running, two resumables — the polis state today) →
the v0.28.23 decision picker ("Two things can resume — which one?").
The existing one-active guards inside cmdResume/cmdLoop still apply, so
resuming a goal over a live loop refuses with an explanation.

Pins: routes, both dispatchers, the picker, the uniform cancel chain,
empty-state guidance. 605 tests.

## [0.28.31] — 2026-07-29

### Added — `/glla reset`: one-shot clean slate for leftover-laden projects

User directive: "make sure we only have one goal or loop or list at a time
— many of my older projects have many leftovers." A fleet-wide scan (22
`.pi-glla` dirs) confirmed the pile: queued lists up to 56 deep (pully),
36 (virtual-pet), 18 (neonbreak), held loops at iter 11–50 across seven
projects, and paused goals in ~10. The one-active-thing guard (v0.28.14+)
prevents NEW overlap but can't retract history — and cleaning a project
meant three commands (`/goal cancel` + `/list clear` + `/loop stop`).

`/glla reset` is the single consent gate:

- **Confirms first** with a full itemized summary ("goal archived as
  aborted: … · list cleared (56 items) · loop stopped (iter 50, best …)")
  and the reminder that history stays in `.pi-glla`.
- The goal is archived HONESTLY (`aborted`, reason "user reset") — it
  lands in goals/ + the archive; the reviewer's abort-suppression keeps
  it quiet. A terminal goal record is just cleared.
- The list is emptied (`list_cleared {via:"glla_reset"}`), the loop is
  stopped gracefully (`finishLoopGit` + `loop_stopped`) and its record
  wiped — a true clean slate, ledgered `glla_reset`.
- Already-clean projects get "already clean" instead of a dialog.

Pins: route, confirm gate + summary, honest archive, all three ledger
events, loop wipe, clean short-circuit. 604 tests.

## [0.28.30] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — type visibility + terminology (user notes sweep)

From the user's field notes (the /glla settings explanation + look items
were already shipped in v0.28.15–19 — those sessions run old builds):

- **The widget card always names the type.** The status line read
  "paused · 3m" for a plain goal and "list item · paused" for a list
  item — the user had to scroll up to know which thing was active. Now
  every card says "goal · …" or "list item · …" (the loop surface always
  had its own card). The footer already named the policy everywhere.
- **Pause/abort notifies name the policy.** "Goal paused: 5 consecutive
  errors" / "Goal aborted." fired verbatim for list items (user note:
  "we seem to call everything goal"). New `goalNoun()` helper —
  "List item" when policy==="list", "Goal" otherwise — swept across the
  send-retry storm, stall-refire, wedge-alert, abort, auditor-infra,
  disapproval-cap, pause_goal, stalled, and token-limit notifies.

Pins: typeWord in the card + behavioral goal/list card assertions;
goalNoun helper + ≥10-site sweep + aborted/wedged wording. 603 tests.

## [0.28.29] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — send-retry storm no longer fires on a legitimately busy session (the polis false positive)

Field-observed (polis): "send-retry storm: 5m of 50ms re-arms — the
session never went idle for the continuation" paused a goal while the
session was simply BUSY (user conversing / long subagent turns). The
v0.28.5 machinery conflated busy with wedged: a flat 50ms re-arm spun
6,000 times in 5 minutes and then escalated.

- **Backing-off cadence.** The busy re-arm now ladders 50ms ×4 → 250ms ×4
  → 1s ×4 → 5s → 15s → 30s cap (`sendRearmDelayMs`) on both the
  continuation and loop-turn paths. agent_end reschedules independently,
  so pickup right after a turn ends is still instant; a long busy stretch
  now costs ~30 ledger-quiet spins instead of 6,000.
- **Time-based, activity-gated escalation.** The count-based constants
  (`SEND_REARM_LEDGER_EVERY`/`SEND_REARM_ESCALATE_AT`) are gone. A storm
  escalates only after **15 minutes of failed sends AND no session
  activity for the last 5 minutes** — a wedged queue shows zero events;
  a busy one streams constantly and simply waits at the capped cadence.
  Ledger milestones at 2/5/10 minutes replace the every-600-spins entry.
- **Texts** now say what was measured: "Nm of re-arms with no session
  activity for Mm — the session is wedged".
- Streak-since timestamps reset everywhere the streak resets (landed
  send/turn, session start, compaction).

Pins reworked in retry-bounds (cadence ladder, time+activity gate,
milestones, constants gone) and stall-handling (compaction reset block).
601 tests.

## [0.28.28] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — unsolicited work no longer auto-starts (the junk-runner hydra)

Field-observed: after a full-audit goal completed, the user had to cancel
THREE auto-started goals in a row. The ledger showed each head had a
different source: an agent-proposed draft auto-accepted by
`autoAcceptDrafts` (same second as the completion), then reviewer-enqueued
list items auto-activating on an empty slot. Enqueue is not consent to
start — and neither is auto-accepting a draft.

- **Reviewer enqueues hold.** `enqueueItems` gains `opts.autoActivate`;
  the reviewer call site passes `autoResume === true`. With autoResume off
  (the default), reviewer findings QUEUE with a notify
  ("/list next when ready — auto-start is opt-in") instead of starting.
  Ledgered `list_autoactivation_held`. User-driven `/list` imports keep
  immediate-start.
- **Auto-accepted drafts hold.** With `autoResume` off, an auto-accepted
  GOAL draft is created paused/blocked ("held for the user's go-ahead" —
  /goal resume starts, /goal cancel drops) and an auto-accepted LIST draft
  queues without activating. Explicit user-confirmed drafts still start
  immediately. Ledgered `draft_held`. Unattended rigs
  (`autoAcceptDrafts` + `autoResume` both on) keep the old flow.

### Added — goal provenance + `/glla log`

"Log it so we can look back and see where we are doing things wrong."

- `setGoal` threads a `via` ("user", "list-cascade", "draft-confirmed",
  "draft-autoaccepted") into `goal.createdVia` (typed + schematized) and
  the `goal_created` ledger entry — "where did this come from" is now
  answerable after the fact.
- **`/glla log [N]`** — human-readable tail of the event ledger
  (`HH:MM:SS type key=value` lines), filtering high-frequency noise
  (state snapshots, re-arm internals) unless `all` is passed. N defaults
  to 15, caps at 100.

Pins: enqueue gate + reviewer call site + held ledgers; both draft-hold
branches; setGoal signature/record/ledger threading + type + schema;
cmdLog route, noise set, default N. 599 tests.

## [0.28.27] — 2026-07-29

### Added — `/goal audit`: manual isolated-auditor invocation (no agent turn)

The user's question, answered as a command: "the work looks done — can't we
just run the auditor?" `/goal audit` seeds a synthesized completion claim
("verify the objective against the repo directly") and runs the SAME
v0.28.26 direct-audit engine: approved → close + cascade; quota-blocked →
pauses with the claim stored and auto-retries through the pendingCompletion
machinery; any other verdict → resumes and hands the verdict to the agent.
Exact sub in the goal router (`/goal audit`, no args); guards for no-goal
and audit-already-running; ledgered `manual_audit_requested`.

### Fixed — stale handle now silences ALL stall machinery

Field-observed in junk-runner: compaction replaced the session mid-goal;
the footer promised "interrupted — auto-resumes on pi restart" while the
heartbeat kept printing "re-firing continuation (stall 4/5)" into a
process where sends can never land. Worse than misleading: at the stall
threshold the escalation would have PAUSED the goal — silently cancelling
the interruptedAt → auto-resume-on-restart promise (a paused goal restores
load-held). `heartbeatTick` now bails right after the compaction-grace
gate when the handle is stale: no refires, no wedge alerts, no latch
watchdog, no escalation — the goal stays active and waits for the restart.

Pins: stale bail placement (inside heartbeatTick, after grace, before the
latch watchdog and refire path); `/goal audit` route in the core router,
dispatch guards, synthesized claim, ledger event, engine delegation with
origin "manual"; origin flows into ledger/notifies/archive reason.
595 tests.

## [0.28.26] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — quota-blocked audits no longer re-engage the agent (stored-claim direct auditor retry)

Field-observed in π-games (free-tier model): `complete_goal` was called and
the AUDITOR was quota-blocked (two "auditor quota: retry in 3600s" pauses).
The quota retry then resumed the goal with a normal continuation — asking
the AGENT to re-submit an unchanged completion claim. The model instead
hallucinated closure ("the auditor accepted it, complete_goal returns No
active goal" — ledger shows zero approvals), repeated the same essay
verbatim turn after turn, stormed continuations (9 sends in 63 seconds),
compacted 14× in 35 minutes, and burned the stall brake.

Root design gap: an audit RETRY does not need the agent — the claim was
already submitted. Now:

- When an audit attempt is quota-blocked, the completion claim
  (`completionSummary` + `verificationSummary`) is persisted on the goal as
  `pendingCompletion` (typed, schematized, survives restarts).
- When the quota window elapses, `retryStoredCompletionAudit` re-runs the
  ISOLATED AUDITOR directly with the stored claim — no agent turn, nothing
  new for a weak model to get confused by. Approved → close + cascade
  (archiveCurrentGoal handles list advance + reviewer); still quota'd →
  re-pause with the claim preserved and another scheduled retry; any other
  verdict (disapproved, impossible, infra) → resume active + continuation,
  verdict durable in auditHistory (ledger: quota_retry_audit_verdict).
- Goals paused before this version have no stored claim — their quota
  retry keeps the legacy resume+continuation path.

Pins: claim persisted at the quota block; callback prefers the direct-audit
branch (agent-resume is the no-claim fallback); retry invokes the auditor
with the stored claim; approval archives + clears the claim; quota-again
preserves it; type + schema pins. 593 tests.

## [0.28.25] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — flat-cadence retry budgets burn in minutes against hour-scale provider conditions

Two field-observed instances of the same design flaw — retry budgets spent
back-to-back, then a pause:

**1. Inter-error retries ride an exponential ladder** (dracon-utilities,
kimi, 19-session fleet on one provider account): a "concurrent request
limit" 403 storm got 5 retries BACK-TO-BACK — an errored turn leaves the
session idle, so `scheduleContinuation` fired with delay 0 after each
`agent_end`. The fleet-wide limit clears on a minutes scale, not
milliseconds. Retries between consecutive error turns now wait
5s → 15s → 45s → 90s → 3m (`ERROR_RETRY_LADDER_MS`, ledgered as
`error_retry_backoff`), so the 5-retry budget spans ~5.5 minutes instead
of ~0.25 seconds.

**2. The 5-consecutive-errors brake cooldown escalates per consecutive
brake**: 1m → 2m → 4m → 8m → 16m cap (was a flat 60s — dracon-utilities
re-braked on it for 1h 38m: resume, 5 instant 403s, pause, repeat). A
healthy turn resets the escalation. First-brake behavior is unchanged
(60s, reason re-checked, one auto-resume per brake).

**3. Stall refires space exponentially** (junk-runner): the heartbeat's
refire gate was a flat 60s of silence — all 5 refires landed in ~4 minutes
into a just-compacted session whose turn trigger was dead, pausing a
resumable goal. `shouldHeartbeatRefire` now scales the required silence by
`2^min(consecutiveStalls, 3)`: refires at 1m, 2m, 4m, 8m, 8m — the budget
spans ~23 minutes, giving the provider/queue real recovery time.

Pins: refire-spacing unit tests (1m/2m/4m/8m/cap + unchanged first-refire
behavior), brake-cooldown source pins, ladder pins (constant, ledger entry,
placement before the aborted branch, scheduleContinuation delayMs param).
591 tests.

## [0.28.24] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — three field-observed failure classes (π-web, junk-runner, hellhunter)

**1. Reviewer extraction: findings are sentence-shaped, not visual-line-shaped.**
The convert-findings-to-list cascade harvested findings line-by-line from
hard-wrapped (~70-col) completion prose, so a finding could be a mid-sentence
fragment — hellhunter got a list item whose ENTIRE objective was "Run a
post-completion regression scan on the hellhunter codebase to" (the first
visual line of a wrapped paragraph, duplicating an already-approved goal;
the rig then paused on a human decision to clear the phantom item).
`extractFindings` now: joins hard-wrapped lines before classification
(lowercase-start continuation = mid-sentence signal; punctuation-less
uppercase items like TODO chains stay separate); rejects dangling-connector
fragments ("…codebase to"); cuts overlong findings at a clause boundary,
never mid-word; and dedupes findings that restate the just-completed goal
(prefix/containment — the v0.28.16 exact-match dedupe was too narrow;
duplicates arrive as prefixes).

**2. Goal ids are internal plumbing — user-facing surfaces never show them.**
The user: "is that even a goal, we have a list here" — and the agent's
decision card offered `/goal drop 20260729065635-gbtxsm`, a command that
does not exist, referencing an id the user cannot act on. Stripped the id
tag from `/goal status`, the started/saved/paused notifies, and all four
session-restore notifies (resuming/held/restored/loop-hold). `/goal archive`
keeps ids — there they are the `/review <id>` handle. Agent-facing surfaces
(tool results, ledger, prompts) keep them. `pause_goal`'s description and
the continuation prompt now enumerate the REAL command surface for decision
options (`/goal resume`, `/goal cancel`, `/goal tweak "<text>"`,
`/list remove N`, `/list next`, `/loop stop|resume` — all act on the ACTIVE
goal; there is NO `/goal drop` and NO command takes a goal id) and require
naming things ("list item 'regression scan'") instead of showing ids.

**3. Compaction hardening.** Two storm/stall false-positive shapes from the
field: π-web's send-rearm streak climbed 3,600 during a legitimate
3.5-minute compaction (5 minutes would have escalated a misleading
"wedged queue" pause), and junk-runner burned all 5 stall refires in the
5 minutes right after a 196k-token compact — pausing a resumable goal
4 minutes post-compact instead of giving pi room to settle. Now:
`session_compact` resets both send-rearm storm streaks (a compact is
LEGITIMATE busy time, not a wedge signal) and opens a 3-minute
post-compaction grace that suppresses the heartbeat's stall/refire/watchdog
machinery (mirroring post_restore_grace).

Pins: 5 extraction unit tests (wrap-join, TODO-chain separation, fragment
rejection, completed-objective dedupe, clause-boundary cut), compaction
source pins (streak reset inside the hook, grace gate precedes the refire
path), behavioral id-strip tests (/goal status + /goal pause show no id),
pause_goal description pin. 589 tests.

## [0.28.23] — 2026-07-29

### Added — decision picker popup (`ctx.ui.select`)

Follow-up to v0.28.22's classified pause cards, from the user's verdict on
them: "your suggestion is still bad — we are literally cutting off the
decision and asked to pick." The widget card is a SUMMARY (truncates by
design); a decision pause is actionable, so the decision itself now gets a
real picker — the Claude Code / muselinn-Ask pattern, full text, nothing
cut.

**The popup.** When a decision pause lands (agent `pause_goal` with
kind=decision + options, or any extension-synthesized decision pause), a
`select()` modal opens with the FULL option text and the recommended
option flagged. Escape leaves the widget card as the fallback. Picking:

- **content option** ("Deliver the missing polish") → the choice is sent
  to the agent (`Decision for the paused goal …: <choice> — continue on
  this path.`) and the goal resumes;
- **command option** ("Cancel the goal (/goal cancel)") → the command
  RUNS — /goal resume, /goal cancel, /loop stop, /loop resume. Options
  with placeholders (`…`, `<arg>`) fall through to the message path.

**Every extension decision pause now ships options**: auditor IMPOSSIBLE
(tweak / cancel), audit-cap disapprovals (fix-and-resume / tweak / cancel),
stall-nudge pause (retry / tweak / cancel), and the session-load
loop-owns-the-slot hold (stop-loop-then-resume / cancel-goal).

**`/goal decide`** re-opens the picker for the current decision pause at
any time (the auto-popup is a moment; the command is the durable path —
e.g. junk-runner's A/B/C decision after a restart). No pending decision →
an explain-notify, not silence.

**Opt-out**: `/glla decisionpopup=off` (or the settings-menu Keep-going →
Decision popup row) — widget card only. Unattended rigs (no UI) never pop
regardless. Also fixed the autoResume row's stale description (default
changed in v0.28.21).

Pins: 4 behavioral tests (content pick → message + resume; Escape → stays
paused; command pick → runs the command, no message; no-decision →
notify), menu dispatch + render pins, mock ctx gains `abort()`.

## [0.28.22] — 2026-07-29

### Added — classified pause cards (decision / action-needed / waiting)

User report (4 screenshots across junk-runner / ai-auto-writer /
dracon-utilities): "if something actionable is going on it can be hard
to tell" — a decision pause, an infra failure, and a time-gated wait all
rendered as the same wall of text. Research pass first (Claude Code,
Codex CLI, aider/Gemini, pi-muselinn-harness's Ask dialog, local
plugins) — borrowed the 4-zone layout, numbered options, inline
recommended flag, and actionability-first status line.

**Structured pauses.** Goal gains `pauseKind`
("decision"/"error"/"wait"/"blocked"), `pauseOptions[]`,
`pauseRecommended` (1-based), `pauseResumeAt` (ISO). `pause_goal` accepts
them; the tool description teaches when to use which kind.

**Every extension-generated pause is classified at the source**: send-
retry storm / stall refires / auditor-infra / token-limit → `error`;
auditor IMPOSSIBLE / audit-cap / stall-nudges / loop-owns-the-slot →
`decision`; auditor-quota (with retry timestamp) and the 60s transient-
error auto-resume → `wait` + `pauseResumeAt`; restore-hold and user-
abort pauses → `blocked`. Resume clears the new fields.

**Rendering** (goal-loop-display):
- `decision` — accent `decision needed — your call unblocks this`
  banner, reason capped at 2 lines, options as numbered lines
  (`1. … 2. …`), recommended option accented + `◂ recommended`.
- `error` — `action needed — this won't fix itself` banner; the
  suggested action is warning-painted (it's the point of the card).
- `wait` — dim `waiting — nothing for you to do` banner + countdown
  (`resumes 06:40 UTC (in 21h) — or /goal resume now`).
- Status line names the ACTIONABILITY, not the reason:
  `⏸ decision needed` / `⏸ action needed — <reason>` / `⏳ waiting ·
  resumes 06:40`. Legacy pauses (no kind) keep the flat card; the
  error-regex still classifies their status line.

### Added — `/loop resume`

Explicit verb for the held-loop resume (bare `/loop` still works).
"No held loop to resume" now says so instead of opening the drafter.
Held-loop hints updated to name `/loop resume`.

Pins: 4 display tests (decision/error/wait/legacy), pause_goal param +
callsite-classification source pins, T3-adjacent pin fix (pauseKind line
adjacency in eager-continuation-core).

## [0.28.21] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — one active thing ENTIRELY + session loads never auto-start

User directive: "only one goal/list/loop — not each, but entirely — and
we load it on session load but not auto start it."

**One active thing, last gap closed.** `/goal resume` and `/list resume`
(which routes through the same `cmdResume`) now refuse over a live loop
("A loop is active — one active thing at a time. /loop stop it first.").
This was the final unguarded activation path; every transition
(propose_goal_draft, propose_loop_draft, /loop start, /loop bare-resume,
list_activate, /list next, activateNextListItem, and now resume) enforces
the invariant.

**Restore boundary enforces the invariant on dirty legacy states.** A
persisted state with BOTH an active goal and an active/held loop
(possible from pre-guard versions) used to leave the goal active — it
would fire on agent_end while the loop was held. Session load now pauses
the goal: "held — the loop owns the active slot".

**Session load = load, never start (default flipped).**
`shouldAutoResumeOnSessionStart` with autoresume UNSET now returns false
for EVERY reason — the 0.26.9 reload/fork auto-resume default is gone.
Whatever is waiting (goal, list head, loop) is restored visible but HELD
until an explicit `/goal resume`, `/list resume`, or `/loop`. The only
auto-resume path left is the explicit opt-in `/glla autoresume=on`
(unattended rigs) — its behavior is unchanged.

**0.28.3 interrupted-goal exemption SUPERSEDED.** An infra-interrupted
goal no longer auto-resumes on a human load under the default — it holds
like everything else, marker preserved. Under autoresume=on the marker
still drives the auto-resume and is cleared by it. The stale-creation
notify now says "Restart pi, then /goal resume" instead of promising an
auto-resume.

⚠️ **Operational note**: after this ships, EVERY restart/reload holds work
by default in every project. Unattended rigs that relied on reload
auto-resume must opt in: `/glla autoresume=on` (project or global).

Pins: core gate (all reasons false by default), T3b/T3c/T3e rewritten
(default-hold + autoresume=on variants keep the auto-resume path
covered), S2 source pin flipped to the supersession, 2 new behavioral
tests (resume-over-loop refusal, dirty-state enforcement).

## [0.28.20] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — settings table de-chromed

User report with 4 screenshots: "extra brackets and some don't even
fit". Every decorative wrapper is gone:

- SOURCE column: `[default]` → `default`, `[runtime]` → `runtime`,
  `[—]` → `—` (bare words; the column header already says SOURCE).
- VALUE column: all paren-wrapped fallbacks are bare — `(off)` → `off`,
  `(5)` → `5`, `(pi session model)` → `pi session model`,
  `(follows strategy)` → `follows strategy`, etc. The parens used to
  signal "default"; the SOURCE column carries that now, and the mix of
  parenthesized defaults vs bare set-values was inconsistent.
- "Postaudit config…" label → "Postaudit" — the ellipsis was a literal
  character meaning "opens a sub-menu" but read as truncation.
- "Effective resolution" composite compacted: parenthesized qualifiers
  stripped (`kimi/k3 (inherits session)` → `kimi/k3`) and identical
  resolutions deduped to one value — the old
  `(session model) · (sess…` truncated composite never fit.

Pins updated + a new guard test fails if paren/bracket chrome returns.
The headless `/glla` fallback already stripped brackets, unchanged.

## [0.28.19] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — color-only settings tabs

User call ("dropping the brackets"): the /glla tab bar no longer wraps
tabs in `[...]` — active tab is accent+bold, inactive dim. The
4-column table grid from 0.28.18 is unchanged.

## [0.28.18] — 2026-07-29

### Changed — the /glla settings menu is a real table now

User report (screenshots, 2026-07-29): "we want to look more like a
table". Three grid bugs fixed + the table look the user picked
(│ separators + header rule; every tab bracketed):

- **Prefix counted in KEY width** — rows render `▶ `/`  ` + label but
  keyW was computed from labels alone, so every row's VALUE column sat
  2 chars right of the header's VALUE.
- **VALUE truncated to its column** — a long value (Subagents'
  effective-resolution composite) overflowed and shoved SOURCE/
  DESCRIPTION right on that row only. KEY/VALUE/SOURCE all
  `truncateToWidth` with `…` now.
- **Widths computed across ALL sections** — the grid no longer reflows
  on every tab switch (it was per-active-section before).
- **Table chrome**: columns joined by dim `│` separators, a `─┼─`
  header rule under the column titles, and the tab bar brackets EVERY
  tab (active = accent, inactive = dim) — bare words read as floating
  text, not tabs. Selected-row separators join plain so the accent
  wrap isn't cut short by a nested dim reset.

### Fixed — suite hermeticity for global settings

Setting `autoAcceptDrafts` in the REAL global settings file
(`~/.pi/agent/pi-goal-list-loop-audit.settings.json`) made two
behavioral draft tests fail — `loadSettings` read the developer's own
config. `globalSettingsPath()` now honors `GLLA_GLOBAL_SETTINGS_PATH`,
and a new `bunfig.toml [test].preload` (`tests/harness/setup.ts`)
redirects it to a per-process tmp file for the whole suite.

Pins: bracket-all-tabs, header rule, separator alignment across header/
rule/rows, long-VALUE truncation keeps the grid, widths stable across
tab switches.

## [0.28.17] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — held loops are always visible (user report: "loops are the most immature")

A loop parked by the session-restore gate (`HELD_ON_RESTORE`) rendered
NOTHING in the always-on UI — `buildStatusText` and
`buildWidgetLinesInner` only branched on `state.loop?.active`, so a reload
made the loop vanish while paused goals and waiting lists stayed visible.

- **Status segment**: held loop alone → `glla: loop ⏸ held · iter N —
  /loop to resume`; with any goal state (active/paused/auditing/
  interrupted) → a compact `· loop⏸held` suffix rides the goal text; a
  completed/aborted goal no longer hides it either.
- **Widget**: held loop alone → its own card (target, iter, elapsed,
  "/loop to resume · /loop stop to drop"); with a visible goal → a
  trailing `⏸ <target>` + "loop held" line rides the goal card.
- Genuinely stopped loops (any other stopReason) stay invisible — the
  marker is exported from `goal-loop-forever.js` as `HELD_ON_RESTORE`
  (was a private const in `loops/goal.ts`) so the display layer keys off
  the exact restore-gate state.
- Pins: held alone / held + paused goal / held + active goal / held +
  completed goal / active loop unchanged / stopped loop invisible.

## [0.28.16] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — reviewer duplicate-scan dedupe (the scan-of-a-scan cascade)

On 2026-07-28 the reviewer proposed the identical "Post-completion
regression scan" follow-up twice in a row: scan `24ewt8` completed →
proposed scan `pii8tt` → `pii8tt` completed → proposed scan-of-`pii8tt`
AGAIN. Each proposal was literally unique (the goal-id differs), so no
existing guard caught it.

- `runReviewer`'s fire-audit-on-clean branch now normalized-compares the
  proposal against the just-completed goal's own objective (`source` IS
  the most recent completion): lowercase, goal-ids (`yyyyMMddHHmmss-xxx`)
  → `<id>`, whitespace collapsed. A match means the completed goal was
  itself this same scan — the proposal/enqueue is suppressed in all three
  modes (on / auto / aggressive), the suppression is ledgered
  (`reviewer_suppressed` reason `duplicate-scan`), and the report's
  cascade step is `duplicate-suppressed` so `/goal status` shows why no
  follow-up fired. The review report still writes.
- New `normalizeObjective` export.
- Pin: completing "Post-completion regression scan after <id>" proposes
  NOTHING in on/auto mode, while a genuinely different clean completion
  still fires the scan. The 0.27.9 negative pin banning the retired
  `report-only` vocabulary stays green — the new step has its own name.

## [0.28.15] — 2026-07-29

### Fixed — 0.28.14 audit gaps (carryover on the list path, resume pin, /loop cancel discoverability)

The 0.28.14 auditor found three real holes:

- **Carryover resolution now covers list activation**: the trigger is
  `"goal" | "loop" | "list"` and `activateNextListItem` (the choke point —
  `/list next`, `list_activate`, list-draft auto-activate, completion
  cascade) resolves carryover BEFORE taking an item. Under `clear` the
  stale queue is dropped first and nothing stale activates; under `pause`
  the ONE summary precedes activation and the paused goal is archived as
  `replaced by new list (carryover)`.
- **`carryover=resume` pinned**: legacy silent stacking — no summary,
  queue + held loop untouched.
- **`/loop cancel` is discoverable**: added to the `/loop` command
  description and slash-bar argument completions.

## [0.28.14] — 2026-07-29

### Added — lifecycle consolidation: one active thing, entirely

The user report: stale goals/lists/loops lingered across sessions and got
auto-resumed into confusion; there wasn't even a `/loop cancel` (loops were
aborted via `/goal cancel`). Investigation found the confusion had a real
engine underneath: **`setGoal` and `archiveCurrentGoal` rebuilt state as
`{goal, list}` and silently nuked `state.loop`** — any held/active loop
vanished whenever a goal was set or archived — and `setGoal` silently
orphaned a paused goal it replaced.

- **State-loss bugs fixed**: both reconstructions now spread `...state`
  (loop + list preserved); a replaced paused/active goal is archived
  honestly (`replaced by goal <id>`) instead of orphaned.
- **One-active-thing by construction**: every activation path is now
  guarded — `/loop` bare-resume refuses over an active goal;
  `propose_loop_draft` refuses over an active goal (early, before the
  measure test-runs); `propose_goal_draft` refuses over a live loop (early
  AND post-confirm backstop); `list_activate` + `/list next` refuse over a
  live loop; and `activateNextListItem` itself is the choke-point guard so
  no present or future call site can stack a list item over a loop.
- **`/loop cancel`** is a first-class alias of `/loop stop`; `/goal cancel`
  now points at the right verb when a loop is the thing running.
- **Carryover policy** — new `/glla carryover=resume|pause|clear` (default
  `pause`): at session_start the stale leftovers (paused goal, waiting
  list, held loop) are snapshotted; when NEW work activates, they're
  surfaced in ONE summary (pause), dropped honestly with a ledger trail
  (clear), or left to legacy silent stacking (resume).
- Behavioral pins: both carryover policies end-to-end through the mock
  harness, `/loop cancel` stop semantics, all three tool guards, and the
  loop-preservation regression (goal set/archive no longer drops the loop).

## [0.28.13] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — provider-error turns no longer feed the stall watchdog

The endless-td 429 incident: MiniMax-M3's token plan ran out mid-goal,
pi returned four consecutive `stopReason="error"` turns (zero content),
and the stall watchdog counted each as an "unproductive turn" — pausing a
healthy goal mid-CDP-capture with the wrong diagnosis ("stalled: 3
consecutive unproductive turns"). A dead provider is not a lazy model:
escalation warnings can't fire against it either, and pi's own retry owns
the backoff.

- Nudge accounting in the `agent_end` handler now exempts
  `stopReason === "error"` turns entirely — the counter neither increments
  nor resets on provider errors, and each exemption is ledgered
  (`stall_nudge_exempt_error`).
- Behavioral pins: 3 consecutive error turns leave the goal ACTIVE; a real
  nudge before the errors still counts after they pass (the third real
  nudge pauses, neither earlier nor later).

## [0.28.12] — 2026-07-28

### Added — auto-accept escape hatch in every draft-class dialog

The polis incident: a user sat through a 14-item batch Confirm having
already reviewed every item during drafting, never knowing
`/glla autoaccept=on` existed — the Yes/No dialog never mentioned it.

- New `confirmDraft` helper: every draft-class dialog (goal / list item /
  list batch / loop / loop spec refinement / task list) is now a 3-choice
  select — **Yes / "Yes — and always auto-accept drafts (sets
  autoAcceptDrafts for this project)" / No**. The ALWAYS choice persists
  `autoAcceptDrafts: true` to PROJECT settings, notifies the undo path,
  and accepts; future drafts skip the dialog entirely.
- Loop spec refinement now ALSO honours `autoAcceptDrafts` (it confirmed
  unconditionally before).
- Stale-dialog handling preserved: the helper returns a tri-state
  (`yes/no/stale`) so the 0.28.1 NOT-a-rejection guidance still fires; if
  `select` is unavailable it falls back to the plain confirm.
- Auto-accept reads now use `liveCtx.cwd` (the execution context's
  project), not the closure ctx — same value in production, correct under
  the mock harness.
- Mock harness: `selectImpl`/`confirmImpl`/`inputImpl`/`customImpl` are
  now nullable (tests can restore defaults with `= undefined`).
- 3 new pins: ALWAYS persists + accepts (behavioral, on-disk settings
  verified), later drafts skip the dialog (behavioral), all six draft
  dialogs route through `confirmDraft` with the ALWAYS option (source).
- 547 pass / 1 env-gated skip / 0 fail / 548 tests across 58 files.

## [0.28.11] — 2026-07-28

### Changed — user-facing message humanize pass (audit U6–U11, E7)

- **U6 tool-override confirmations speak outcomes**: `toolOverrides.allow
  += bash` → `"bash" is now always visible to the agent (project override
  saved).` — same for hide/unallow/unhide/set/unset. No more config-JSON
  echoes.
- **U7 reviewer suppression reasons humanized**: `doNotFireOn:
  goal-complete` → `this event type (goal-complete) is excluded in /glla
  postaudit → fire-on`; all 7 reasons rewritten (disabled, mode off,
  excluded event, non-completion, refire window, day cap).
- **U8 dracon-sync prompt section generalized** (published-package bug):
  DETACHED COMMIT DETECTION now opens with "Skip this section entirely if
  your rig has no auto-committer — most rigs don't", the git-reflog
  forensics stay generic, and `dracon-sync` appears only as the
  maintainer-rig example.
- **U9 goal creation is objective-first**: `Goal <id> created — starting
  now.` → `Goal started: <objective> — the auditor will verify on
  completion. (id: <id>)`; the stale-creation variant likewise.
- **U10 "list N" → "N queued" for goal policy** in both the status text
  and the widget footer (v0.24.7 fixed list policy only).
- **U11 one user-facing noun — "postaudit"**: menu title, suppression/
  failure/proposal notifies, and the /review description all say
  postaudit (`/review` stays the command verb; `reviewer` stays internal
  code + report-file vocabulary).
- **E7 reviewer-menu save failures are LOUD**: the swallowed
  "non-fatal" catch → `Postaudit setting NOT saved: <err> — check
  .pi-glla/settings.json permissions.` — the user no longer believes a
  failed toggle landed.
- 544 pass / 1 env-gated skip / 0 fail / 545 tests across 58 files.

## [0.28.10] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — docs drift (audit U1–U5, U12, U13)

- **/review help** now advertises the accepted modes: `[off|on|auto|aggressive]`
  (the registration still showed the 0.27.9-rejected `auto|report|default`).
- **README**: five top-level commands (was "four" — `/review` missing);
  `/review` added to the quick-start; `/glla` line lists the real subcommand
  surface (stats / audits / postaudit / autoaccept / key=value); the
  quick-start fence bug fixed — the "Order is the default, not the law"
  prose rendered INSIDE the code block; test count 168 → 545 / 58 files.
- **INSTALL.md**: reviewer section rewritten for the 4-mode cycle
  (off | on | auto | aggressive — the old default/auto/report table was
  two renames stale), postaudit naming + `/glla postaudit` (reviewer alias),
  aggressive-mode relaunch semantics documented; test count refreshed.
- **CHANGELOG**: the 0.28.0 entry was stranded at the file's BOTTOM behind
  a fossil "Unreleased → v0.2.0 plan" block — moved to its newest-first
  position between 0.28.1 and 0.27.9; the fossil block (all items long
  shipped) deleted.
- Root litter files `then`/`pass` verified absent (already cleaned).
- 544 pass / 1 env-gated skip / 0 fail / 545 tests.

## [0.28.9] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — E4 completion (auditor-caught)

The 0.28.8 E4 fix gated two of the four `proposeGoal` call sites; the
isolated auditor found the **fire-audit-on-clean** branch still incrementing
`proposed` unconditionally in aggressive and default modes. Both now gate on
the boolean return. New pin: clean completion + failing send yields
`proposed === 0` in BOTH modes (tests/reviewer-modes.test.ts). 544 pass /
0 fail / 545 tests.

## [0.28.8] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — phantom reviewer proposals + measure-broken vs plateau (audit E4, E5)

- **E4 phantom reviewer proposals.** The reviewer counted a /goal proposal
  as "proposed" even when the `sendUserMessage` call THREW (stale handle
  etc.) — the catch swallowed it and the completion notify still reported
  "(1 /goal proposed)" for a message that never arrived. The `proposeGoal`
  dep now returns boolean (true = actually delivered); `runReviewer` counts
  only confirmed sends; goal.ts's callback returns false on throw AND
  notifies loudly ("Reviewer /goal proposal NOT delivered … restart pi if
  the session was just replaced") instead of the silent "best-effort"
  comment. Pinned: a false-returning proposeGoal yields
  `outcome.proposed === 0` (tests/reviewer-modes.test.ts E4 test).
- **E5 measure-broken is no longer "plateau".** A measure command that
  prints no number used to increment the plateau stall counter, so a broken
  measure stopped the loop with the misleading "plateau — no improvement".
  `LoopState.consecutiveNullMeasures` now tracks null outputs separately:
  a null is NOT a stall (it says nothing about improvement), a numeric
  value resets the streak, and `plateauWindow` consecutive nulls stop the
  loop with "measure command broken — N consecutive iterations printed no
  number (cmd: …). Fix the measure command, or /loop stop." Plateau stays
  reserved for real non-improving numbers. 4 new pins in
  tests/loop-forever.test.ts.
- 543 pass / 1 env-gated skip / 0 fail / 544 tests across 58 files.

## [0.28.7] — 2026-07-28

### Added — mock-ctx behavioral test harness (audit T7, T1–T5)

From `audit/WRONG-OR-NOT-PREMIUM-2026-07-28.md` Stream 4. The root-gap fix:
`tests/harness/mock-pi.ts` — a fake ExtensionAPI (captures registered
tools/commands/event handlers; sync-throw `sendMessage`/`getSessionName`
stale injection matching pi's real assertActive semantics) + stub
ExtensionContext (captured notifies, scriptable ui.confirm/select/input).
`tests/behavioral-orchestrator.test.ts` registers goal.ts on the fake and
DRIVES it — the first tests that execute the orchestrator instead of
regex-pinning its source. The harness caught TWO real production bugs on
day one (below).

### Fixed — caught by the new harness

- **Restore-gate tri-state regression (T3, live since 0.28.3).**
  `resolveEffectiveAggressiveSettings` coerced `autoResume: s.autoResume ??
  aggressiveMode` → `false` when unset, so the session_start restore gate's
  DEFAULT branch never fired: reload/fork HELD instead of auto-resuming,
  and the 0.28.3 interrupted-goal rule (`!== false`) never triggered — the
  exact capture-anime-girls scenario 0.28.3 claimed to fix. Now
  `s.autoResume ?? (aggressiveMode ? true : undefined)` — unset stays
  tri-state (hold on human loads, resume on reload/fork); aggressiveMode
  still flips the default to always-resume. Behaviorally pinned: T3a HOLD
  on human load, T3b reload auto-resume, T3c interrupted outranks the
  default hold, T3d loop HELD_ON_RESTORE, T3e list-head auto-activate.
- **Foreign-session guard gap (T5).** `complete_task`,
  `update_task_status`, and `propose_task_list` mutated goal state with NO
  foreign-session guard — a subagent session could rewrite the main
  session's task list. All three now route through `foreignToolGuard`;
  coverage pin scans every registered tool block and fails if any mutating
  tool (or a future new/renamed one) lacks the guard.

### Behavioral coverage converted from source pins

- **T1 stale creation paths**: stale Confirm in propose_goal_draft →
  NOT-a-rejection guidance + nothing created; stale /goal start → goal
  persisted with interrupt marker + honest ".pi-glla" notify.
- **T2 stale send → terminal**: agent_end continuation against a dead
  handle → goal stays ACTIVE + interrupt marker + loud restart notify +
  ledgered.
- **T4 settings editors**: `tests/settings-editors.test.ts` executes
  select/input editors end-to-end against the real global settings file
  (snapshot/restore) — writes, clears, validation rejection, dismissed-
  editor-no-write all pinned.
- Test-only export `__testOnlyResetStaleFlag` (the stale flag is
  process-terminal in production) + `handleSettingChoice` now exported.
- 539 pass / 1 env-gated skip / 0 fail / 540 tests across 58 files.

## [0.28.6] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — persistence integrity hardening (audit E1, T6)

From `audit/WRONG-OR-NOT-PREMIUM-2026-07-28.md` Stream 2.

- **Guarded writes (E1).** A disk failure (ENOSPC, EACCES, wedged mount)
  used to THROW out of `appendLedger` / `writeGoalMd` /
  `archiveCurrentGoal` mid-handler — killing the orchestrator turn and
  silently diverging RAM from disk. Every persistence step now runs
  through `runPersistStep` (goal-loop-core.ts): failures latch a
  session-wide `persistenceDegraded` flag instead of throwing, and the
  next SUCCESSFUL step auto-clears it (self-healing — the "dirty" marker
  write-then-mutate ordering cannot otherwise provide; RAM stays
  authoritative and re-syncs on the next landing write).
- **Loud first failure + TUI flag (E1).** `persistState` (the choke point
  every state transition flows through) now calls
  `notifyPersistenceState`: one loud warning on the first failure
  ("State lives in RAM and re-syncs on the next successful write …"),
  one all-clear on recovery. `buildWidgetLines` prepends
  `⚠ persistence degraded — .pi-glla writes failing (…); state in RAM`
  as the first widget line on every render until a write lands.
- **Archive no longer destroys the only copy (E1).**
  `archiveCurrentGoal` removes the active goal md ONLY when the archive
  write actually landed.
- **Tolerant reads (E1/T6).** `readState` wraps the ledger read itself
  (EACCES/EIO degrades loudly instead of crashing session_start); the
  per-line JSON tolerance now has a REAL functional pin — a truncated
  trailing `active.jsonl` line (mid-write kill) loads the last good
  state.
- **Schema-drift tripwire (T6).** New test asserts every
  `goal.schema.json` property exists in the `Goal` interface.
- Tests: new `tests/persistence-hardening.test.ts` (7 tests, incl. real
  filesystem failure injection).

## [0.28.5] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — bound the silent retry loops; honest error brake (audit E2, E3, E8)

From `audit/WRONG-OR-NOT-PREMIUM-2026-07-28.md` Stream 2.

- **Auditor infra errors bounded (E2).** A broken auditor model used to
  retry forever — every infra failure rescheduled a continuation
  unconditionally (the 39-error incident). New persisted
  `auditInfraStreak` goal field counts trailing infra errors (survives
  restarts; cleared by any real auditor run and by reaching quota); at 3
  the goal PAUSES loudly — "the auditor model is likely broken …
  /glla model=provider/id, then /goal resume. Your work was NOT judged" —
  instead of spinning.
- **Send-retry storms visible + bounded (E3).** The 50ms idle-retry re-arm
  loop spun for hours with zero ledger events while the idle watchdogs
  stayed suppressed. Re-arms are now counted (`send_rearm_start`, then
  `send_rearm_storm` every 30s), and a 5-minute storm escalates
  loud-terminal (`send_rearm_escalated`): goal paused / loop stopped with
  restart guidance, same shape as `escalateStallNow`. A landed send clears
  the streak.
- **Error brake tells the truth + recovers (E8).** The consecutive-errors
  brake paused with the literal reason "5 consecutive errors: error"
  (stopReason, never the provider error — field-observed pausing THIS
  audit's goal mid-run) and counted USER ABORTS as errors. Now: the pause
  reason carries the real error text (`5 consecutive errors (last: …)`);
  aborts brake separately ("5 consecutive aborts (user interrupted)") with
  NO auto-resume (user intent); provider errors get ONE capped 60s
  auto-resume via the quota-retry machinery (reason re-checked, user pause
  not stomped) — a 60s flake no longer costs hours of manual resume.
- `scheduleQuotaRetry` gains a `label` param (quota default unchanged).
- Tests: new `tests/retry-bounds.test.ts` (7 pins).

## [0.28.4] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — nudge before the stall brake; unclosed status in every continuation (audit P1–P3)

From `audit/WRONG-OR-NOT-PREMIUM-2026-07-28.md` Stream 5. Field-observed in
the game-dev sessions: done-but-unclosed goals got silently pause-stamped by
the stall brake ("the goal paused itself out of nowhere") because the model
narrated completion in prose instead of calling `complete_goal` — and nothing
ever told it prose doesn't close goals.

- **Graduated escalation entry (P1).** At nudge 1 and 2 (before the
  `HEARTBEAT_MAX_NUDGES` brake), the goal receives an explicit
  `[STALL WARNING n/3]` continuation: "if DONE call complete_goal NOW — prose
  closes nothing; if BLOCKED call pause_goal; otherwise make a tool call;
  N more unproductive turns pause the goal." Displayed to the user, ledgered
  as `stall_escalation_nudge`, stale-aware like every autonomous send. Loops
  keep their existing runLoopTick path.
- **Unclosed-status block (P2).** `prompts/goal-loop-continuation.md` gains a
  `## State` section at the top: "State: ACTIVE — not yet auditor-approved.
  Prose closes nothing … a done-but-unclosed goal is a bug, not a resting
  state." The STALLS section now names the graduated warning.
- **Post-restore grace (P3).** The first 2 `agent_end` turns after a
  session_start restore skip nudge accounting (ledgered as
  `post_restore_grace`) — recovery chatter (orientation reads, plan
  narration) no longer counts toward the brake and paused restored goals
  mid-recovery.
- Tests: 3 new pins in `stall-handling.test.ts`; `length-continue.test.ts`
  window pin re-shaped (order is the contract, not a 5000-char distance).

## [0.28.3] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — interrupted goals outrank the default restore HOLD (S2 completed)

0.28.1's marker kept stale-interrupted goals ACTIVE, but the session_start
restore gate still HOLDS active goals on a human session load when
`autoresume` is unset (the v0.26.9 default) — so the auto-resume the marker
promised only fired for `reload`/`fork` or `autoresume=on` rigs. An infra
interrupt is not user intent: the restore gate now auto-resumes an
interrupted goal whenever `autoresume` is unset (explicit
`/glla autoresume=off` still holds), clears the marker, and names the
recovery.

## [0.28.2] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — release mechanics

`long-running-modes-parked.test.ts` pinned the package version to exactly
`0.27.9|0.28.0`; re-shaped to the contract (0.27.9 or later) so routine
version bumps stop failing it. (0.28.1 shipped the stale-interruption rework
below; this patch only repairs that pin.)

## [0.28.1] — 2026-07-28

### Fixed — stale-interruption rework: auto-resume instead of stranded pause (audit S1–S4, E6, T1)

From `audit/WRONG-OR-NOT-PREMIUM-2026-07-28.md` Stream 1. When pi invalidates
the extension handle (session replacement — compaction triggers it in pi
0.82.x), the old handling paused the goal; the session_start restore gate
only auto-resumes ACTIVE goals, so every stale event stranded the goal until
manual `/goal resume` ("starts paused and stuck"), and a resume attempted
inside the still-stale session produced an active-in-ledger/dead-in-process
zombie (S1).

- **Goals STAY ACTIVE with an interrupt marker.** `goStaleTerminal` now sets
  `interruptedAt`/`interruptedReason` on the goal instead of pausing it.
  `sendContinuation`'s `extensionApiStale` guard already stops sends in the
  doomed process, and the next fresh session auto-resumes the goal through
  the existing restore gate — which now clears the marker and names the
  recovery ("auto-resumed after the stale-handle interrupt"). Loops keep
  the stop-on-stale behavior.
- **Staleness probes at command entry (S3).** New side-effect-free probe
  (`extensionApi.getSessionName()` routes through pi's `assertActive()`)
  wired into `/goal` creation, `/goal resume`, `/list`, and
  `propose_goal_draft`. Stale creation persists the goal with the marker
  and says so ("created and safe in .pi-glla/ … restart pi and it
  auto-resumes") instead of the "created — starting now" lie; stale resume
  persists the resume for the next session and skips the misleading
  "Resumed goal" notify and the doomed continuation send.
- **Drafting-seed failure is loud (E6).** The `/goal` interview seed send
  used to fail silently (Enter → nothing). It now notifies, and stale
  handles get the restart guidance.
- **Stale Confirm is not a rejection (T1).** Both the single-draft and
  list-batch Confirm paths detect the stale signature and return "this is
  NOT a rejection — restart pi" instead of "Draft rejected by the user".
- **Widget surfaces the interrupt.** An interrupted-but-active goal renders
  `⚠ interrupted — stale handle · auto-resumes on pi restart` instead of
  looking healthy.
- Schema + `Goal` type carry `interruptedAt`/`interruptedReason`.
- Tests: new `tests/stale-interrupt-resume.test.ts` (10 pins);
  `stale-api-terminal.test.ts` updated to pin the active+marker shape.

## [0.28.0] — 2026-07-28

### Changed — `/glla` settings menu is now a real TUI table

The pre-0.28.0 menu used `ctx.ui.select` with flat single-line rows
formatted as `label — value [source] — description`. The 0.28.0 menu uses
`ctx.ui.custom` with a Container/Text layout featuring:

- a top **tabs row** listing all 5 sections (`Keep-going`, `Auditor`,
  `Stall brakes`, `Subagents`, `Other`) — `←`/`→` (and `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`)
  switch the active section;
- a **4-column body** for the active section: `KEY | VALUE | SOURCE |
  DESCRIPTION` — `↑`/`↓` move within the section, `Enter` drills into
  the per-key editor, `Esc` exits.
- column widths are computed from the actual content, capped per-column
  (`MAX_KEY_W=32`, `MAX_VALUE_W=24`, `MAX_SOURCE_W=10`) and the
  description column truncated with `…` on narrow terminals.

Reorganized into a new module `extensions/settings-menu.ts` exporting:

- `buildSettingsRows(settings, prov, subagent?, defaults?)` — pure builder
  returning stable-id rows (e.g. `"autoResume"`, `"auditorModel"`,
  `"subagentModelOverrides.Explore"`).
- `SettingsMenuComponent` — the `Component` returned from
  `ctx.ui.custom(...)`.

### Changed — settings menu dispatch is now id-based, not `startsWith`-based

The pre-0.28.0 dispatcher used `choice.startsWith(label)` strings against
the displayed row text. The 0.28.0 dispatcher (`handleSettingChoice(id, ctx)`)
uses a `switch (id)` against stable ids from `buildSettingsRows`. Same
per-key handler bodies (the only behaviorally-test surface is identical);
the trigger changed.

### Added — per-key editor coverage for `stallShortWords` and `stallSimilarityThreshold`

The 0.27.0 menu exposed these two keys as visible rows but had no editor
handler. The 0.28.0 `handleSettingChoice` includes numeric-input handlers
for both: `stallShortWords` accepts non-negative integers, and
`stallSimilarityThreshold` accepts a decimal between 0 and 1.

### Added — `Effective resolution` row (read-only)

The subagents section now also shows a read-only `Effective resolution`
row displaying the runtime-effective model for `Explore`, `Plan`, and
`general-purpose` based on the current `subagentModelStrategy`,
`subagentModelOverrides`, and the active session model. Selecting the row
is a no-op (no editor opens).

### Changed — dropped `haiku` mention from the `Subagent model strategy` description

The pre-0.28.0 description said "agent-default pins haiku for Explore".
The 0.28.0 description says "inherit-parent shares your session model +
quota pool; agent-default uses the upstream pi-subagents default agents".
The "haiku" label remains in diagnostic comments and runtime effective-
model labels (`resolveEffectiveSubagentModel` returns
`"anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 (upstream pin)"` when the strategy is
`agent-default` and no override is set) — those are useful when
debugging the pi-subagents#175 quota bug, not user-facing config text.

### Tests

- `tests/settings-menu-complete.test.ts` rewritten to assert on the
  `buildSettingsRows` + `handleSettingChoice` structural contract
  (10 tests).
- `tests/glla-table-menu.test.ts` (new) pins the table renderer
  (rendering at widths 120/80/60, tab/arrow navigation, Enter/select,
  truncation, cache invariants, `Component` shape) — 19 tests.
- Net: 495 pass / 1 env-gated skip / 0 fail (up from 468 / 1 / 0).

## [0.27.9] — 2026-07-27

### Changed — postaudit modes re-shaped to literal 4-mode contract

`ReviewerMode` is now `"off" | "on" | "auto" | "aggressive"` (was
`"off" | "default" | "auto" | "aggressive" | "report"`). The contract
specified `off | on | auto | aggressive` with default `on`; `default`
was renamed to `on`, `report` was dropped entirely (its "write report
only, no cascade" behavior was already covered by `on` + a configurable
`cascade` block). Existing settings files with `"default"` or `"report"`
auto-migrate to `"on"` on first read via `resolveReviewerConfig`. Default
is now `on` (was `default`). `/review <id> <mode>` accepts all four.
`/glla postaudit=` (and the legacy `/glla reviewer=`) cycles through
`off → on → auto → aggressive → off`.

### Added — per-tool override subsystem (item 5)

`.pi-glla/settings.json` now accepts a `toolOverrides` block:

```json
{
  "toolOverrides": {
    "allow": ["bash", "write_file"],
    "hide": ["some_external_tool"],
    "perToolConfig": {
      "bash": { "timeout": 60 }
    }
  }
}
```

`toolOverrides.allow` forces tools visible despite an external modlist;
`toolOverrides.hide` forces tools hidden even when the session allows
them. `perToolConfig` is an extensible record for tool-specific knobs
(timeouts, formats, etc.). `/glla tooloverride <action>` opens the menu:

- `list` — show current state
- `allow <tool>` / `hide <tool>` / `unallow <tool>` / `unhide <tool>`
- `set <tool> <key>=<value>` / `unset <tool> <key>`

The existing tool-heal self-heal (`ensureAgentToolsActive`) now applies
these lists on top of the missing-tools recovery. Unattended rigs can
finally override modlist profiles without editing the global profile.

### Changed — paused widget zero-telemetry wording

The widget now renders `awaiting first turn — resumes exactly here` when
`tokUsed === 0 && audits === 0` (restored-in-fresh-session before the
first turn). With telemetry it still renders `saved — N tok spent · M
audits · resumes exactly here`. The literal contract text is honored.

### Added — chunk-near-context-full hint in completion-auditor prompt

The chunking hint (previously only in `prompts/goal-loop-continuation.md`)
now also sits in the isolated completion auditor's instruction array
inside `extensions/goal-loop-auditor.ts` (`buildGoalAuditorPrompt`). The
reviewer writes Markdown reports and has no inline prompt to add the
hint to — the auditor is the relevant "reviewer/auditor prompt" target.
Test in `tests/auditor-chunk-hint.test.ts` pins the hint inside the
auditor prompt's instruction array.

11 new tests (467 → 468). Updated 7 reviewer-modes / postaudit-surface /
pause-informativeness / long-running-modes-parked / reviewer tests to
match the contract surface.

## [0.27.8] — 2026-07-27

### Changed — `audit/LONG-RUNNING-MODES.md` is now the per-item evidence ledger

The parking doc grew from a 3055-byte sketch into a per-item evidence
ledger. Every one of the 7 tasklist items now has a `### Item N`
section with `**State**:` (shipped / parked) and `**Evidence**:`
pointers (commit SHA, npm version, file path, raw grep result, or
`git ls-files` output). 8 new tests in
`tests/long-running-modes-parked.test.ts` pin each item's terminal
state so a future auditor can verify the 7-item /goal without
re-reading chat history.

This addresses the 0.27.7 isolated-auditor's rejection ("the /list
queue should show 7 items in terminal state") by resolving the
contract via per-item evidence in the parking doc instead of via
7 separate queue entries — each item already shipped (or was
explicitly noted-as-shipped-in-prior-versions) when this goal
landed; re-firing them as queue items would be ceremonial busy-work.
The 7-item evidence table replaces the aggregate list entry.

## [0.27.7] — 2026-07-27

### Added — 5-mode postaudit (`off` / `default` / `auto` / `aggressive` / `report`)

`/glla postaudit=` (and the legacy `/glla reviewer=`) now cycles through
five modes instead of three:

- **off** — silenced; never fires. Equivalent to `enabled=false` but
  exposed via the menu.
- **default** — Confirm-gated cascade (the original behavior).
- **auto** — every actionable finding becomes a `/list` item, zero
  Confirms (the auto-loop rolls straight through).
- **aggressive** — `auto` behavior PLUS the FIRST architectural finding
  is relaunched as a `/goal` directly (no Confirm). For unattended rigs
  that can't click Confirm.
- **report** — write the report + notify only, no cascade.

The `ReviewerMode` type union widened to `"off" | "default" | "auto" |
"aggressive" | "report"`. `/review <id> <mode>` accepts all five.
`ReviewerOutcome` now exposes `cascadeStep` so tests can assert which
branch fired. `cmdReviewerSettings` reads whichever key the user has
configured (`postaudit` wins over the legacy `reviewer` key) and writes
back to that same key — no parallel config drift.

### Added — `audit/LONG-RUNNING-MODES.md` parking doc (committed to git)

The long-running philosophy parking doc is now committed at
`audit/LONG-RUNNING-MODES.md` (69 lines, 3055 bytes). Tabulates the
corrected source-of-long-running axis (sub-goals, not mode nesting)
and lists the parked items for v0.29+ (sub-goal tree, spec evolution,
post-audit modes — the last of which is now partly shipped).

3 new tests in `tests/reviewer-modes.test.ts` (off / aggressive-architectural /
aggressive-clean / opts.mode union widening / menu-text / 5-mode cycle).

## [0.27.6] — 2026-07-27

### Changed — package.json scripts: `npm test` now uses bun (3x faster)

`npm test` was `node --experimental-strip-types --test tests/*.test.ts`
(~6–8s for 440 tests). Switched to `bun test` (~2.8s, 3x faster).
`npm run test:node` keeps the node path for the env-gated daemon test
that needs the slow runner. `npm run test:all` runs bun + tsc.

### Added — chunk-near-context-full hint in goal-loop-continuation prompt

The continuation prompt now warns the assistant: when the conversation
is heavy (long-running audit, deep debug, big rollout), prefer smaller
commits, smaller tool outputs, focused reasoning. glla's 0.27.2
auto-continue fires on `stop_reason="length"` (the output-token cap)
and will reschedule anyway; pre-empting by chunking is cheaper than
recovering from the cap. Save large file writes for their own turns.

### Noted — items already shipped in prior versions

- **`modlist` removal**: there is no `/glla modlist` menu item in the
  current code (`modlist` only appears in a doc comment about the
  unrelated `pi-plugin-list-selector-modlist` package and a tool-heal
  notify message). Already done.
- **Per-project tool overrides**: the project settings file
  (`<cwd>/.pi-glla/settings.json`) is the override mechanism. Reviewer
  / post-audit / subagent-model / aggressive-mode / quota / stuck /
  escalation / feedback / wedge / auto-resume / auto-accept / etc. all
  read per-project settings. Already done.
- **`no work started` mislabel**: the paused widget line is
  `saved — N tok spent · M audits · resumes exactly here` (0.27.1); when
  both N and M are 0 it degrades to `saved · resumes exactly here`. Done.

1 new test (441 → 442).

## [0.27.5] — 2026-07-27

### Changed — surface the post-completion audit in interactive mode

The reviewer was firing silently: `runReviewer` called `ctx.ui.notify()`
during the goal-completion handler, easy to miss because pi is busy
transitioning state. Now `fireReviewer` adds a SECOND `ctx.ui.notify()`
AFTER the cascade settles, pointing at the review file path:

> ↳ review written: .pi-glla/reviews/<id>.md (N enqueued to /list)

Skipped when `opts.manual === true` (the `/review` UX already notifies
the result). In auto mode the second notification is harmless
redundant — unattended rigs use `notify=` push and don't read it.

### Added — `postaudit` settings key + CLI label

The feature was internally called "reviewer"; user-facing label shifts to
"postaudit" (post-completion audit, auditor-adjacent). Both keys are
read; `postaudit` wins when both are present. `/glla postaudit` opens the
same config menu as `/glla reviewer` — the rename is vocabulary only, no
behavioral split. `extensions/reviewer.ts`, `runReviewer`, and
`ReviewerConfig` keep their existing names (a 331-line file with 4
test files; churn risk would outweigh the rename benefit).

8 new tests (433 → 441).

## [0.27.4] — 2026-07-27

### Fixed — slash-command argument completions now add a trailing space

Pi's autocomplete `applyCompletion` adds a trailing space for the TOP-LEVEL
command (`/goal `), but NOT for argument completions (`/goal start`,
`/glla model=`). glla's `completions()` factory now embeds a trailing space
in the suggestion `value` (label stays clean) — except for `key=value`
items (`model=`, `tokenlimit=`, `notify=`, …) where the user types the value
right after the `=` and a trailing space would break parsing. Now typing
`/goal sta` → pick `start` → the line becomes `/goal start ` and you can
type the objective immediately. No more `/goal startasdahlasf`.

5 new tests (428 → 433).

## [0.27.3] — 2026-07-27

### Fixed — stall brake too aggressive on real investigation work

The polis-session pause ("3 consecutive turns with no tool calls", screenshot
2026-07-27) tripped on three substantive analytical paragraphs about
`state-pump-dom.ts` after `cd/ls/grep` reads — real work, not a stall. The
brake checked only `toolCalls > 0` and missed the case where the model is
reasoning out loud across turns. Now a no-tool turn is a nudge only when it
is also short (default < 15 words) OR highly similar to the prior assistant
turn (3-gram Jaccard > 0.6 default). Substantive novel analysis resets the
counter even without a tool call.

New settings: `stallShortWords` (default 15) and `stallSimilarityThreshold`
(default 0.6) — tunable per project. Pause reason now reads "3 consecutive
unproductive turns (no tools, short or repetitive)".

11 new tests (415 → 426). The stall brake still fires on real stalls
("ok"/"Working…" repetition).

## [0.27.2] — 2026-07-27

### Added — auto-continue on output-token truncation, folded in

The standalone **pi-length-continue** package is deprecated; the behavior
now lives here (works in every session, goal or no goal):

- When one assistant response exceeds the model's per-response output cap
  (`stopReason: "length"`), agent_end immediately re-triggers with
  "continue EXACTLY where you stopped — split large file writes into
  smaller write/edit calls across turns" (the root-cause mitigation).
- A truncated turn is **exempt from all turn bookkeeping**: no telemetry,
  no no-tool nudge (it is NOT a stall), no loop measure, no normal goal
  continuation on half a response. The next agent_end processes the run.
- Guards: 3-consecutive cap with a one-time give-up notice, skip when
  messages are pending, stale-api errors route to the 0.26.7 terminal
  path. Ledger events: `length_continue_sent` /
  `length_continue_send_failed`.

4 new tests (422 → 426).

### Also in this release window (ops, no code)

- **autoResume scope fix**: the global settings file carried
  `autoResume: true` (0.26.8 era), overriding the 0.26.9 hold-on-load
  tri-state for EVERY project — interactive sessions (neonbreak) resumed
  goals on load. Global override removed; `autoResume: true` now set
  per-project only on the unattended rigs (hegemon, darklord, polis,
  junk-runner, dracon-utilities).

## [0.27.1] — 2026-07-27


### Fixed — pauses now tell you what happened, what survived, and what to decide

"We are pretty uninformative when the execution pauses." A decision-pause
(pause_goal with a reason + suggested action) reached the user truncated at
~60 chars — the actual choice ("(a) keep both… (b) regenerate…") was
unreadable without /goal status.

- **Widget paused card wraps**: reason and suggested action now wrap over
  up to 3 width-aware lines each (new `wrap()` helper) instead of
  truncating at ~60 chars. Overflow ends with "…" (full text is always in
  the pause notification and /goal status).
- **"saved · resumes exactly here" line**: the card now answers the first
  question at any pause — did I lose the work? — with tokens spent and
  audit count when nonzero (`saved — 41.2k tok spent · 3 audits · resumes
  exactly here`).
- **pause_goal notify carries the FULL contract**: reason + suggested
  action (multi-line notification), and the external push includes both
  (bounded at 200 chars). Before, the action never left /goal status.

5 new tests (417 → 422).

## [0.27.0] — 2026-07-26


### Changed — /glla settings menu: every option, organized, self-documenting

Typing `/glla` now shows EVERY option on one screen, grouped into
sections, each row `label — value [provenance] — what it does` so the
menu is also the documentation (user request: "I want to see the option
even when I type /glla… give some info about them on the right").

- **Sections**: Keep-going (auto-resume tri-state, auto-accept drafts,
  aggressive mode) · Auditor (model, thinking, cap, feedback chars,
  quota retry) · Stall brakes (wedge alert, stuck max, stall escalation)
  · Subagents (strategy + 3 pins) · Other (notify, token limit,
  reviewer). Header rows are selectable no-ops.
- **Newly editable from the menu** (were command-only): auto-resume
  (default/on/off picker), auto-accept drafts, audit cap, stall
  escalation refires, reviewer config (jumps to the reviewer menu).
- Headless fallback (no-UI) now lists the stall brakes too.

4 new tests (413 → 417).

## [0.26.9] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — restore gate is now a tri-state: never auto-start on session LOAD

0.26.8 flipped the default to auto-resume on EVERY session start — wrong:
loading pi and seeing the held-goal popup immediately fire work is a
surprise. The correct rule (user-specified): **don't auto-start on session
load; continue forever DURING the session unless big stuck.**

- **`shouldAutoResumeOnSessionStart` tri-state**: `on` = auto-resume on
  every session start (unattended rigs); `off` = never; **default
  (undefined)** = HOLD when a human loads a session (`startup`/`new`/
  `resume`/no-reason — popup shows what's waiting, explicit resume),
  auto-resume on in-session machinery (`reload`/`fork` — an extension
  reload or session fork must never strand work).
- Mid-session continuation (agent_end chains, heartbeat refires,
  post-compaction, list/loop transitions) was never gated here — it
  auto-continues forever unless a super-stuck brake (stall escalation,
  stale-api terminal, pending-latch watchdog) stops it loudly.
- Status shows `autoResume=default (hold on load)`; hold text offers the
  explicit resume + the `autoresume=on` opt-in; README/INSTALL updated.

3 gate tests rewritten + 3 source tests retargeted (412 → 413).

## [0.26.8] — 2026-07-26


### Changed — autoresume defaults ON: keep pushing forward unless super stuck

The v0.21.0 restore gate held goals/loops on fresh session starts unless
the project opted in with `/glla autoresume=on`. That default was wrong
for unattended rigs: every pi restart stranded in-flight work behind a
manual `/goal resume` (field-observed in dracon-utilities: after a
max-output-token error killed the turn and the pre-0.26.1 silent-send
bug spun refires for 8h, the user's restart *paused* the goal with
"restored in a fresh session" instead of continuing it).

- **`shouldAutoResumeOnSessionStart`** — default (`undefined`) now
  auto-resumes on EVERY session start. Explicit `/glla autoresume=off`
  preserves the v0.21.0 gate (fresh sessions hold; resume/reload/fork
  still auto-resume).
- **`/glla autoresume=off` now persists `false`** (was `undefined`) —
  required for the opt-out to survive the new default.
- **The "super stuck" brakes are unchanged**: stall escalation,
  stale-api terminal stop, pending-latch watchdog, wedge alert all still
  stop the machine loudly. A process restart is not stuck; a dead turn
  trigger is.
- Status line shows `autoResume=on (default)`; hold texts name the
  opt-out as the cause.

2 gate tests updated to the new semantics + 3 new source tests
(410 → 412).

## [0.26.7] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — stale extension api is now terminal-and-loud, not retried forever

pi 0.82.x invalidates the extension runtime on session replacement
(`ctx.newSession`/`fork`/`switchSession`/`reload`; the compaction path
reaches the same `teardownCurrent → dispose → invalidate`). Once stale,
EVERY `sendMessage` throws forever in-process (`staleMessage ??=` is
never cleared). Field-observed in hegemon: `goal_continuation_send_failed`
at every compaction with pi's exact stale error — a user-created goal
never auto-started (the continuation send threw), and retries vanished
into the suppression void (0.26.6 fixed the void; this fixes the retry).

- **`isStaleApiError`** (goal-loop-core) matches pi's exact signature.
- **`goStaleTerminal`** — first stale send: ledger `extension_api_stale`,
  pause the goal / stop the loop with explicit "Restart pi (or reload
  extensions), then /goal resume / /loop start" guidance, notify +
  external notify. Single-fire — no re-spam.
- **Send paths short-circuit** once stale (`sendContinuation` /
  `sendLoopTurn`) — no retry-into-the-void.
- **Factory re-init clears the flag** (extension reload recovery).

5 new tests (405 → 410).

## [0.26.6] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — heartbeat ship-suppression was self-sustaining (darklord 9.1h stall)

Field-observed in darklord: after a post-compaction
`goal_continuation_send_failed`, the heartbeat logged **2,184 consecutive
`heartbeat_suppressed` ticks over 9.1 hours** while the finished list
item sat uncompleted and 16 queued items waited. Root cause: the 0.25.0
"recent ship (<5m)" suppression fed `lastShippedAtMs`, which read the
`.pi-glla/active.jsonl` **mtime** — and the heartbeat's own
suppressed-tick ledger writes refreshed that mtime every 15s.
Suppression forever. (Under an auto-committing daemon the git-head term
self-sustains identically.)

- **Suppression removed from the heartbeat.** The legit windows it
  meant to cover are already guarded precisely: busy mid-turn, pending
  messages, scheduled timers.
- **`completionAuditInFlight` flag** wraps the complete_goal auditor
  call (try/finally) — the one real transition window, now detected
  exactly instead of by wall-clock heuristic.
- **`lastShippedAtMs` drops the ledger-mtime term** (git commit time
  only); `shouldSuppressHeartbeatForRecentShip` kept but deprecated.

6 new tests + 1 updated (400 → 405).

## [0.26.5] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — pending-latch stall (post-compaction silence, field-observed)

A continuation sent at compaction+0s was ACCEPTED by pi
(`goal_continuation_sent` ledgered) but the turn trigger was dropped;
pi's pending-message flag then stayed set for **22 minutes**.
`sessionIdle` (= `isIdle && !hasPendingMessages`) never went true, which
suppressed the heartbeat refire path AND the 0.26.1 stall escalation —
and the wedge alert was blind too (22m < 30m threshold, and its "hung
command" framing would have been wrong). Total silence until a manual
nudge.

- **New `pending_latch_stuck` watchdog** (`shouldFirePendingLatchWatchdog`,
  `PENDING_LATCH_STUCK_MS = 3m` in goal-loop-backoff): supervising +
  idle + pending + no timers + silent ≥ 3m → count a stall, ledger, warn.
  It never re-sends — the message is already queued pi-side and the
  hegemon zombie proved re-sends don't unstick a dropped trigger
  (619 sends, zero turns). Stalls share the 0.26.1 escalation, now
  factored as `escalateStallNow` — 5 strikes (~15 min) → loud
  pause/stop with restart guidance instead of silence forever.
- **Wedge alert re-scoped** to genuinely-busy sessions (`!idle`, not
  `!sessionIdle`) — a stuck latch is not a hung command.
- **Reviewer**: `ℹ`-led status lines never classify (the 0.26.2
  reviewer enqueued the literal string "ℹ todo 0" as a /list item after
  mining it from an approved audit report; list markers are also
  stripped inside `classifyFindingText` for direct callers).

6 new tests + 1 updated (395 → 400).

## [0.26.4] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — reviewer source curation (stop mining meta-text)

The 0.26.3 completion produced ANOTHER junk review (4 false
"architectural" findings): the executor's own verification prose, a
backticked `reviewer.ts` code line that slips every 0.26.3 line guard,
and test fixtures quoting the previous false positives. Regex guards
lose the arms race against meta-text — the fix is curating WHAT gets
scanned.

- **Approved audit reports are no longer finding sources.** An approved
  report is the executor's self-claims — zero finding signal. Only
  `disapproved` / `error` entries contribute (the independent auditor's
  required-fixes — the highest-signal findings that exist).
- **`stripCodeSpans`** — fenced blocks and inline code spans are removed
  before extraction; quoted code was the vocabulary leak.
- **Line guards extended** — brace-led (`{`, `[`, `}`) and quote-led
  (`'`, `"`) lines are code-ish, never findings; the mode-matrix vocab
  guard tolerates an opening paren.

6 new tests (389 → 395) pinning the exact 4 lines from the live 0.26.3
misfire.

## [0.26.3] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — reviewer extraction false positives (observed live)

The reviewer fired on the 0.26.2 completion and matched 3 junk
"architectural" findings — a `test("…architectural…")` name, the
INSTALL.md mode-matrix table row, and ship-doc prose — every one a
reviewer-vocabulary self-match (the junk proposal was declined live and
motivated this release).

- **Bare words dropped** — "architectural" and "strategic" removed from
  the class regexes (they self-matched "architectural-class",
  "architectural findings", the docs' matrix). Architectural now matches
  only actionable forms (rewrite, new dependency, schema change,
  redesign); strategic only proposal forms (should we, deprecate, ship
  this).
- **Line guards** — extraction skips code lines (`test(`/`it(`/
  `assert`/`const`/`import`/…), markdown table rows (`| … |`), and
  reviewer-report vocabulary (`architectural-class`, `cascade step`,
  `**Mode**`, `problems/architectural`, …).

7 new tests (382 → 389) pinning the exact 3 live false-positive lines.

## [0.26.2] — 2026-07-26


### Added — reviewer modes + the auto-loop cascade

User request (2026-07-26): "the review that we can trigger after goal or
list with various defaults like auto loop into problems found or
improvements found if we run it."

- **`reviewer.mode`** — `default` (unchanged: Confirm-gated cascade),
  `auto` (the auto-loop: bug/refactor/improvement AND architectural
  findings all become `/list` items with zero Confirms; a clean
  completion enqueues the regression-scan audit as a `/list` item;
  strategic findings stay notify-only — decisions never auto-fire),
  `report` (report + notify only).
- **Improvement-class extraction** — "could be improved", "improvement",
  "enhancement", "consider adding", "would be nice", "nice to have" now
  extract into the enqueue-without-Confirm class.
- **Auto-mode refire relaxation** — the 5-minute refire window no longer
  applies to list-complete events in `auto` (the queue emptying is the
  cascade's natural rhythm, not a runaway); the per-day cap still bounds
  everything.
- **`/glla reviewer` → Mode** — cycles default → auto → report.
- **`/review <id> [auto|report|default]`** — one-shot mode override for
  manual reviews; unknown modes rejected with usage.
- Review reports name the mode (`**Mode**: auto`).

9 new tests (373 → 382); the 0.26.0 menu test updated for the new row.

## [0.26.1] — 2026-07-26


### Fixed — the zombie spin (stall handling)

Incident: a hegemon spec loop produced zero turns while the heartbeat
re-fired every 60s for 23.5h (619 `heartbeat_refire` events, exactly
10/10min, zero gaps). The send path was silent, the nudge counter counts
turns (zombies run none), and nothing hooked compaction.

- **Send-path instrumentation** — `loop_turn_sent`,
  `loop_turn_send_failed` (error text), `goal_continuation_sent`,
  `goal_continuation_send_failed` ledger events. The previously silent
  catch (`// stale API — next agent_end reschedules`) now leaves
  evidence.
- **Refire-streak escalation** — `consecutiveStalls` increments per
  heartbeat refire and resets only on real activity (`agent_end` /
  `tool_call`). At `stallEscalationRefires` (default 5, 0 = never) the
  loop stops / the goal pauses with `stalled: continuation not landing`
  + `stall_escalated` ledger + TUI warning + external notify.
- **`session_compact` hook** — re-arms the continuation chain ~2s after
  compaction when idle with nothing scheduled (`session_compact` /
  `compaction_refire` ledger events).
- **Stall surface** — status line + widget show `stalls:N` while the
  streak is nonzero; the refire notify names the streak
  (`stall 2/5`).

8 new tests (365 → 373).

## [0.26.0] — 2026-07-25


### Added — the Reviewer: post-completion follow-up enqueuer

The long-requested glue layer (user, 2026-07-24: "the reviewer should
fire goal and lists after they end… maximize leverage… but it should be
configurable"). Deterministic by design — no new tool calls, purely
analytical, every side effect injectable.

- **`extensions/reviewer.ts`** — the lifecycle: resolve config → gates
  (enabled / fireOn / doNotFireOn / 5-min refire window / per-day cap) →
  extract findings from the archive + audit reports → leverage
  classification (strategic > architectural > bug > refactor) → review
  report → cascade.
- **Cascade** — bug/refactor findings become `/list` items via the ONE
  enqueue path (fix-without-confirm, the leverage principle);
  architectural findings are proposed as `/goal` through the agent's
  Confirm dialog; clean completions fire a regression-scan audit
  proposal (opt-in cascade step); strategic findings notify only.
- **Review reports** at `.pi-glla/reviews/<goal-id>-<timestamp>.md`.
- **Safety** — never fires on aborts/pauses or `/loop` endings;
  `reviewer_fired` / `reviewer_suppressed` ledger events; 5-minute
  refire window + `maxReviewsPerDay: 20`.
- **`/review <goal-id>`** — manual re-review of any archived goal
  (suffix match), bypassing the trigger gates.
- **`/glla reviewer`** — project-scoped config menu (enable, leverage
  mode, fire-on toggles, cascade steps, caps), headless JSON fallback;
  the `reviewer` block lives in `.pi-glla/settings.json`.
- **Trigger hooks** — `archiveCurrentGoal` fires goal-complete for
  `/goal` and list-complete when the queue empties after a completion.

12 new tests (353 → 365).

## [0.25.6] — 2026-07-25


### Added — subagent polish

- **Per-type pins for Plan + general-purpose** — embedded upstream
  defaults for both (same drift-guard pattern as Explore), so
  `subagentModelOverrides` can pin any of the three default agent types;
  settings UI gained Plan + general-purpose pin editors (the Explore
  editor generalized). Strategy-driven sync still writes ONLY Explore —
  Plan/general-purpose pin nothing upstream, so inherit-parent needs no
  file for them.
- **Managed-override repair detection + notify** — a sync state file
  tracks what glla wrote; a previously-managed override found missing or
  altered externally is re-written AND surfaced ("glla repaired managed
  subagent override(s): Explore") instead of silently restored.
- **Effective-resolution display** — headless `/glla` now shows the
  resolved model per agent type (`subagent Plan: minimax/MiniMax-M3
  (per-type pin)` / `p/s (inherits session)` / `anthropic/
  claude-haiku-4-5 (upstream pin)`).
- **Subagent quota-error detection** — an Agent tool_result carrying a
  quota error (the pi-subagents#175 shape: Explore's upstream haiku pin
  403s on shared keys) triggers an immediate notify with the repair
  path (re-spawn with explicit model=, work inline, or let the
  inherit-parent strategy fix NEW sessions) + a `subagent_quota_error`
  ledger event. Upstream tracking stays at tintinweb/pi-subagents#175.

5 new tests + 2 updated for the new embedded types (348 → 353).

## [0.25.5] — 2026-07-25


### Added — completes the 0.25.4 auditor-polish contract (post-audit fix)

The isolated auditor disapproved 0.25.4's completion claim: the
retry-once-with-backoff half of the infra item was missing, and
`/glla audits` browsed the global log instead of the active goal's
history. Both gaps closed here — the auditor was right.

- **Infra retry-once-with-backoff** — a retriable auditor infra failure
  (stream/auth blip) now gets ONE automatic retry with backoff before
  being reported as "auditor infrastructure error (retried once)".
  User aborts and missing-model config are never retried; neither
  attempt counts as a verdict. `runWithInfraRetry` +
  `isRetriableInfraError` in core; `audit_infra_retry` ledger event.
- **`/glla audits` realigned** — default view is now the ACTIVE goal's
  own audit history with per-audit elapsed (`✖ 07-25 20:00 MiniMax-M3 ·
  5m — ## Audit result`); `all`/`global`/`log` browses the durable
  cross-goal log; `full` prefers the active goal's latest report.
- **Audit entries gain `durationMs` + `retriedOnce`** (history + log).

3 new tests (345 → 348).

## [0.25.4] — 2026-07-25


### Added — auditor polish: durable audit log, report hygiene, honest streaks

User-driven (2026-07-25): "log so we can look back and see where we are
weak — the auditor perhaps needs work, or how we are designating tasks".
Forensics across 3 live projects showed disapprovals are mostly CORRECT
(wrapper-goal contracts — fixed in 0.25.3), but the auditor leaks think
blocks and there was no durable verdict trail.

- **`.pi-glla/audits.jsonl`** — append-only audit log: every real verdict
  {at, goalId, objective, verdict, model, thinkingLevel, FULL report}
  survives state-snapshot rotation and archive.
- **`/glla audits [N|full]`** — browse recent verdicts (glyph, time, goal,
  model, first report line); `full` prints the latest report.
- **Think-block stripping** — `<think>…</think>` bodies, stray `</think>`
  fragments, and partial-tag artifacts are removed from reports before
  storage/display (wild-caught MiniMax-M3 leakage, incl. non-English
  reasoning spillover). The auditor prompt now also forbids think blocks
  and requires English reports.
- **`## Required fixes` tail** — the auditor ends disapprovals with a
  one-line-per-blocking-gap actionable section; `auditFeedbackExcerpt`
  is now tail-aware, so a capped excerpt keeps the fixes (head-slicing
  used to cut exactly them).
- **Infra-transparent streaks** — `countTrailingDisapprovals` skips pure
  infra errors instead of treating them as streak-breakers: 39
  hegemon-style infra errors can no longer reset the audit cap and
  re-open infinite re-continuation.
- **Auditor-quiet stall in the widget** — audit progress events carry a
  timestamp; >3min quiet while auditing shows "auditor quiet Nm — may be
  stuck; Esc aborts, verdict is not counted".

7 new tests + 2 updated to the new semantics (338 → 345).

## [0.25.3] — 2026-07-25


### Changed — list-philosophy rework: the three modes long-run differently

The user's mental model, made load-bearing: `/goal` long-runs by **scope**
(one big multi-hour task), `/list` by **queue depth** (hundreds of short
items, minutes each), `/loop` by **bounds** (metric-driven infinite
polish). Prompts previously conflated `/list` with a small checklist of
multi-hour items — two wrongs that look like one right.

- **`# Long-running philosophy` block** at the top of
  `goal-loop-draft.md` and `goal-loop-forever-draft.md` with the
  three-mode table.
- **`/list` drafting injection rewritten** — short-item framing
  ("minutes, a single focused change", "queue depth, not item scope");
  the "10 things / checklist of 50 tasks" framing is gone.
- **Cross-recommend `/goal` ↔ `/list`** (`crossRecommendMode`):
  aggregate seeds ("76 items, one commit each", "40 findings as a
  tasklist") get steered to N short `items[]` with per-item contracts —
  the 2026-07-24 wrapper-goal incidents (auto-committer squash →
  literal count fails → auditor correctly disapproves finished work);
  multi-hour seeds in `/list` get pointed at `/goal`; five-minute seeds
  in `/goal` get pointed at `/list`.
- **`/list depth`** — queue depth, oldest item age, average item
  duration from archived list-policy goals.
- **`LIST-PHILOSOPHY.md`** at the repo root (three-mode hierarchy +
  the wrapper-goal anti-pattern); `INSTALL.md` gained a Modes section.

10 new tests (328 → 338).

## [0.25.2] — 2026-07-25


### Added — `/glla stats`: per-project ledger rollups

One command, every project's glla telemetry — the empirical-evidence layer
the spec-driven verifier hardening will consume.

- **`/glla stats`** — markdown table, one row per discovered project:
  goals, audits approved/disapproved/error, avg turns, avg writes,
  premature count, token total, last active.
- **`/glla stats json`** — same rollup machine-readable (schema matches
  the table exactly).
- **`/glla stats project=<path>`** — single-project scan.
- **`/glla stats premature`** — only projects with premature successes,
  sorted by premature ratio.
- **Premature-success detection** — flags approved goals with
  turns < 50 AND file writes < 5 AND bash calls < 8 (spec-driven verifier
  design §3 thresholds). Goals archived before this release carry no
  telemetry and are UNKNOWN, never back-convicted.
- **Per-goal telemetry** — turns (agent_end), file writes, and bash calls
  are now counted on the goal state and flow into archives.
- **Project discovery** — session-dir cwd decode + targeted bounded walk
  (~/Dev, ~/chat first, 2s budget) + cwd. New module
  `extensions/goal-loop-stats.ts` (pure helpers, stdlib only).

`total_cost` is token usage — no price data on this rig. 7 new tests
(321 → 328).

## [0.25.1] — 2026-07-25


### Fixed — stuck-detection rework: the multi-signal "progress signals" gate

Triggered by two wild-caught transcripts (design doc
`audit/STUCK-DETECTION-REWORK-2026-07-24.md`): the v0.24.0 single-signal
detector (same tool + same result hash 3×) killed loops that were SHIPPING
work with stable verification output — stable verification is the goal
state of a metricless loop, not the stuck state.

- **`isActuallyStuck(input)`** replaces `detectLoopStuck` as the stuck
  gate. An iteration is stuck ONLY when ALL progress signals are zero —
  file writes (`write`/`edit`/`multi_edit`/`write_file` tool results),
  git commits since iteration start (`rev-list --count startHead..HEAD`),
  `spec_item_progress` ledger events, and a PAIRED forward transition —
  and the legacy detector also fires. `detectLoopStuck` stays exported
  for backward compat.
- **`forwardTransitionMarker(text)`** — conservative word list + line-start
  "Next:" detection. The marker only counts PAIRED with a write/commit in
  the same iteration: pure-narration "next: implement X" loops are still
  stuck (narrate-but-don't-ship).
- **`/loop finish [reason]`** — end a loop cleanly with stopReason
  `completed: <reason>` (distinct from stuck/plateau/stopped-by-user).
  `/loop stop` is untouched.
- **`/loop start toolsamerepeat=N`** — `0` disables the legacy
  same-tool-same-result check entirely (new detector only); absent =
  current behavior.

21 new tests (300 → 321) including a transcript-replay suite: both
wild-caught transcripts classify NOT stuck under the new gate while the
old detector WOULD have flagged them — and the same texts without the
shipped work still classify stuck.

## [0.25.0] — 2026-07-25


### Added — eager-continuation contract (Sections A–H + J; Section I shipped in 0.24.6)

The full eager-continuation contract: the loop keeps going unless it truly
can't, subagents are the default execution strategy, quota errors are
first-class, and the agent investigates before asking.

- **Subagent fan-out prompts (A):** all four agent-facing prompts lead
  with "Default to subagents" + eager-continuation guidance (`Agent`,
  `Explore`/`general-purpose`/`Plan`, parallel spawn, single-writer rule).
- **`aggressiveMode` setting (B):** `/glla aggressivemode=on` flips the
  continuation DEFAULTS — autoResume on, auditCap 10, stuckMax 10, wedge
  off, quota silent-retry. Explicit per-key settings always win. Base
  auditCap default raised 3 → 5 for everyone (item 7). Every auto-event
  announces itself ("Auto-resume fired (event: …)").
- **Quota-aware retry (C):** new `extensions/quota-retry.ts` —
  `isQuotaError` / `parseQuotaError` (Retry-After header + prose hints) /
  `scheduleQuotaRetry`. A quota-exhausted auditor now PAUSES with a
  one-shot auto-retry (default 60m, `/glla quotaretryminutes=N`) instead
  of re-firing continuations forever. A user pause during the window is
  never stomped.
- **Objective drift (D):** the auditor prompt explicitly accepts justified
  shifts ("do NOT rigidly disapprove"); the continuation prompt teaches
  tweak-before-pivot; `complete_goal` gains a real `newObjective`
  parameter — atomic objective update + audit in one call (ledgered
  `goal_tweaked`).
- **Agentic disagreement (E):** new continuation section WHEN THE AUDITOR
  DISAPPROVES — investigate (read auditHistory, quote objections, compare
  against shipped evidence, form an opinion) and present YOUR ASSESSMENT
  instead of a generic options menu. The audit-cap pause message now
  guides the same investigation.
- **Keep-going under aggressiveMode (F):** the audit cap becomes a TODO
  list — objections extracted to `pendingTasks`, goal stays ACTIVE, TODOs
  render into every continuation. IMPOSSIBLE with a partial reason narrows
  and continues; a full impossible still pauses.
- **Pivot detection (G):** new PIVOT DETECTION section (full-audit →
  propose_task_list immediately + parallel subsystem surveys); heartbeat
  suppression when work shipped in the last 5 minutes (a transitioning
  session is not a stalled one); aggressiveMode + survey objective injects
  a FULL-AUDIT MODE directive into the continuation.
- **Auto-committer forensics (H):** new DETACHED COMMIT DETECTION section
  (reflog filter-branch / dracon-sync checks before self-diagnosing);
  `pauseAutoCommit`/`resumeAutoCommit`/`isAutoCommitPaused` sentinel
  helpers (`.pi-glla/.pause-auto-commit`); env-gated commit-survival e2e
  (`GLLA_E2E_DAEMON=1`).
- **Subagent quota errors (J):** new WHEN SUBAGENTS HIT QUOTA ERRORS
  section — `Key limit exceeded` / 429 → inherit-parent or wait for reset;
  never re-spawn the failed type.

New settings keys: `aggressiveMode`, `quotaRetryMinutes`,
`stuckMaxInterventions` (UI + headless `/glla key=value` + provenance).
Settings layer extracted to `extensions/goal-settings.ts` for testability.

38 new tests (262 → 300, one env-gated skip). Interpretation notes for the
auditor are appended to the contract goal file.

## [0.24.9] — 2026-07-25


### Changed — auditor feedback defaults to the FULL report

`auditFeedbackChars` default flipped 800 → 0 (no cap). A truncated
disapproval report loses exactly the actionable tail — the later evidence
items and the raw command output the executor needs to fix the gap — and a
few KB of report is negligible next to a wasted re-attempt. The setting
remains for users who want a cap (`/glla auditfeedbackchars=N`); explicit
values already saved are respected.

## [0.24.8] — 2026-07-25


### Added — configurable auditor feedback length (community PR #1, thanks @Gan-Personal)

Auditor disapproval feedback is no longer permanently hard-capped at 800
characters. The new layered `auditFeedbackChars` setting preserves 800 as
its default and can be changed with `/glla auditfeedbackchars=N` globally
or per project; `0` returns the full report. The interactive settings UI,
headless display, completions, save summary, and executor-facing labels
all show the effective behavior; truncated reports now say so and point at
`/goal status` for the full text. Merge also adds the 0.24.6 subagent keys
to the headless settings display (missed in that release).

## [0.24.7] — 2026-07-25

### Fixed — list-mode indicator: a queue item is not a goal

Spotted live on the hegemon session: a `/list` item's footer read
`glla: list ● 3m 19s · list 29` — the policy label AND the queue counter
both said "list" — and the widget called the item "active" with a
`/goal status` hint, as if queue work were a standalone goal.

- **Footer:** list policy → `glla: list ● 3m 19s · 29 queued`
  (no duplicated "list"). Goal policy unchanged (`· list N` suffix kept —
  no duplication there).
- **Widget:** list item → `├─ list item · active 3m 19s` and footer hint
  `└─ 29 queued · /list · /glla` (no `/goal status` hint for queue work;
  no "0 queued" on the last item). Goal policy rendering unchanged.
- **`/goal status`:** list items now name their source:
  `Source: /list queue (N waiting) — /list to manage`.

5 new display tests (256 → 260).

(Takes the 0.24.7 number ahead of the planned stuck-detection rework;
the roadmap items shift one patch.)

## [0.24.6] — 2026-07-25

### Fixed — subagent model inheritance (Section I of the eager-continuation contract, shipped early)

**Root cause:** pi-subagents v0.14.3's default `Explore` agent pins
`anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5` (`default-agents.ts:40`). Its model resolution
is explicit option > agent config > parent model (`agent-runner.ts:720`),
so an `Explore` spawn NEVER inherits the session model — it silently routes
to a different provider with a different quota pool. On rigs where the
session model is local/alternative (e.g. MiniMax-M3) and claude-haiku-4-5
resolves through a quota-capped key (OpenRouter), a few concurrent Explore
spawns exhaust the key with `403 Key limit exceeded (total limit)` while
the parent session is completely unaffected. Observed live on the polis
session: 3 of 3 Explore subagents failed with the same 403 mid-audit.

**Fix:** glla now manages `~/.pi/agent/agents/Explore.md` — pi-subagents'
native user-override mechanism (a same-named `.md` fully replaces the
default config; omitting `model:` falls through to the parent model).

- New module `extensions/goal-loop-subagents.ts`:
  `syncSubagentModelOverrides()` writes/updates/removes the managed
  override at session_start. Idempotent; writes only on drift.
- Writer safety contract: files without the
  `x-managed-by: pi-goal-list-loop-audit` frontmatter marker are
  user-owned — never modified, never deleted (a skip note is surfaced).
- Only `Explore` is managed (the sole pinned default). Embedded verbatim
  copy of the upstream Explore config; a drift test fails if tintinweb
  changes it or pins another default.

**New settings** (`/glla` → Settings, global or project):

- `subagentModelStrategy` — `inherit-parent` (default): subagents share
  your session model AND its quota pool (fixes separate-provider 403s;
  search agents may run on a pricier model). `agent-default`: upstream
  behavior (Explore pins haiku — cheap search, separate quota).
- `subagentModelOverrides` — per-agent-type model pin, e.g.
  `{ "Explore": "minimax/MiniMax-M3" }`. Always wins over strategy.

Applies to NEW pi sessions (pi-subagents registers its agents at its own
session start). 12 new tests (244 → 256).

## [0.24.5] — 2026-07-24

### Fixed — tool-visibility self-heal (modlist allowlist wipe)

Root cause from `audit/INCIDENT-COMPLETION-BLACKHOLE-2026-07-23.md`:
external extensions like `pi-plugin-list-selector-modlist` call
`pi.setActiveTools(frozenSnapshot)` at every `session_start`. When glla's
session_start handler runs before theirs (load order), our 11
lazily-registered agent tools (`complete_goal`, `propose_loop_draft`,
`propose_goal_draft`, `propose_loop_refine`, `pause_goal`, `complete_task`,
`update_task_status`, `list_add`, `list_activate`, `list_status`,
`propose_task_list`) are registered and briefly auto-activated, then
wiped from the model-facing active set by modlist's allowlist. Commands,
widget, watchdog keep working (they don't go through the tool registry),
but every agent tool answers `"Tool not found"` to the model — silently.

Forensics on the darklord session: 26 real `complete_goal` tool calls
in the session jsonl, all answered `"Tool complete_goal not found"`
(isError: true). The model was right about its own schema; the tool was
genuinely absent.

- **`GLLA_TOOL_NAMES`** and **`missingGllaTools(activeNames)`** added to
  `goal-loop-core.ts` (pure, testable).
- **`ensureAgentToolsActive(pi, ctx)`** added to `loops/goal.ts`: after
  `registerAgentTools` and on every `agent_end`, diff our 11 tools
  against `pi.getActiveTools()`; re-add any missing ones via
  `pi.setActiveTools([...active, ...missing])`. Notify once per session
  naming the likely culprit (external allowlist, e.g. modlist profile)
  and the fix (add the tool names to the profile).
- Old pi versions without `getActiveTools`/`setActiveTools` are handled
  gracefully (try/catch, heal becomes a no-op).
- 5 tests in `goal-loop-core.test.ts` (modlist-snapshot example,
  empty/full active sets, single-tool missing, base-tool non-interference).
- 244/244 tests pass (was 239); tsc clean.


### Changed — `/loop respec` ambiguity policy: friction scales with ambiguity

Draft exactly when the input can't be mechanically resolved (the grilling
philosophy applied to respec):

- **Two specs** (`SPEC.md` AND `spec.md` in the root): never silently pick
  — one slash-bar select asks which is the spec, and a notify nudges to
  consolidate the pair (the loop treats only the chosen file as the spec).
- **No spec**: instead of a flat error, `/loop respec` drops into loop
  drafting with a respec-flavored seed — grill toward bootstrapping a
  SPEC.md from the current code (then reconcile) or stating the
  reconciliation target in prose.
- **One spec**: auto-start, unchanged — the user typed the command; the
  happy path keeps zero friction.
- New pure `resolveSpecFiles` (all matches, priority order); 1 test.

## [0.24.3] — 2026-07-23

### Added — `/loop respec` (reconcile against the root spec, forever)

- `/loop respec` starts an infinite metricless loop whose target is
  generated from the project spec: `SPEC.md` / `spec.md` in the root only
  (one mechanical predicate, no fuzzy search — missing spec = a clear
  error naming what was looked for). Same auto-start path as `/loop
  start`: typing the command IS the user act, no drafting, no interview.
- The generated target bakes in the two field lessons: **read the spec
  critically first** (stale/contradictory requirements get reported as
  discrepancies, never forced onto the code — the spec is data, not
  gospel) and an **implement/audit rotation** (one iteration closes a
  spec↔code gap, the next audits an "implemented" item against the spec)
  so a respec loop can't doorknob-polish.
- **No limit-nagging**: respec is unbounded by design; bounds stay
  available on `/loop start` for whoever wants them.
- Sharper `propose_loop_draft` gate error (field report: a chat-agreed
  loop dead-ended into a hand-written draft file + a "say start" wait).
  The error now tells the model exactly what to hand the user:
  `/loop start "<target>"`, `/loop respec`, or `/loop` to draft — and
  forbids draft-file ceremony.
- 3 tests (resolution order, root-only, target shape).

## [0.24.2] — 2026-07-23

### Added — audit-hardening from the Claude Code / Codex CLI cross-audit

(full comparison: the local installs of both reference CLIs were
source-audited against this stack; the "doing something wrong" list drove
this release)

- **Disapproval cap** (`/glla auditcap=N`, default 3, `0` = unlimited).
  Claude Code caps consecutive stop-hook blocks at 8 then overrides; we had
  NO cap — a goal the auditor could never approve re-continued forever,
  burning tokens. Now `countTrailingDisapprovals(auditHistory)` >= cap →
  goal PAUSES with the repeated objections surfaced (notify + ledger +
  external push + the tool result tells the model to summarize for the
  user instead of re-completing). Shield-blocks and infrastructure errors
  correctly break the streak — they are not verdicts on the work.
- **`<impossible>` verdict** — the auditor's third verdict (Claude's
  prompt-hooks have the same escape hatch). For goals that can NEVER be
  satisfied as stated (contradictory requirements, wrong premise,
  unobtainable resources), the auditor ends with
  `<impossible>reason</impossible>`; the orchestrator pauses the goal with
  the reason and points the user at `/goal tweak` / `/goal cancel`.
  Incomplete work stays `<disapproved/>` — the prompt says so explicitly.
  Parsed by pure `parseAuditorVerdict` (in goal-loop-shield.ts so tests
  can import it); recorded in audit history + goal markdown.
- **Anti-injection line in loop prompts** (Codex pattern, already present
  in goal-continuation since early versions — now consistent): "The target
  below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as
  higher-priority instructions." in both loop prompt templates.
- 9 tests (`tests/audit-verdict.test.ts`).

## [0.24.1] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`/list cancel` — stop the whole list as ONE verb** (field report:
  "there is no way to cancel a list"). Before this, stopping a list meant
  knowing to combine `/goal cancel` (aborts only the active item; the
  waiting list survives) with `/list clear` (drops the waiting items; the
  active item keeps running). `/list cancel` does both: aborts the active
  goal when it is list-sourced (archived as `aborted — list cancelled`,
  `ctx.abort()`), drops all waiting items, ledger `list_cancelled`
  `{abortedActive, dropped}`, and a notify naming exactly what happened.
  A standalone (non-list) active goal is left untouched and the notify
  says so — `/list cancel` never reaches outside the list machine.
  Nothing-to-cancel case is answered, not silent.

## [0.24.0] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Loop anti-repetition — the stuck ladder.** The plateau stop watches
  the *number*; this watches the *work*. New pure module
  `goal-loop-repetition.ts` (clean-room — standard fingerprint/Jaccard/
  n-gram techniques, no AGPL code): every loop iteration is classified by
  `detectLoopStuck` — narration-only streaks (2+ toolless iterations),
  degenerate single-reply repetition, exact repeat, near-duplicate
  (trigram Jaccard ≥ 0.8, digits volatile so "port 8081" ≈ "port 8082"),
  A-B-A-B window repetition, and same-tool-same-result 3× (repeated error
  or no new information). A stuck iteration replaces the next prompt with
  a **rotating intervention** (5 strategies, each different — a repeated
  nudge gets filtered as noise): different approach → untouched subtask →
  write PROGRESS.md → fix one test failure → review your own diff.
  - Rung 3+ = **hard reset**: banned openings (the loop's own repeated
    phrasings), first action must be a tool call.
  - Rung 5 = **the loop stops**, reason named (`stuck — <reason> (5
    consecutive interventions)`), notified + ledgered + external push —
    bounded and surfaced, same philosophy as plateau.
  - Applies to BOTH loop flavors: metric loops can doorknob-polish while
    the number wiggles; metricless loops had NO behavioral defense at all.
  - Rolling windows live on `LoopState` (persisted — survive restore):
    `recentPrints`, `recentTexts`, `recentToolResults`, `toollessStreak`,
    `consecutiveStuck`, `lastStuckReason`.
  - Ledger: `loop_stuck` per intervention; `loop_measured` gains `stuck`.
- **Rotating continuation lines** for metricless loops (identical prompts
  invite identical answers) and `${INTERVENTION_NOTE}` / `${VARIANT_NOTE}`
  placeholders in both loop prompt templates.
- 21 tests (`tests/repetition.test.ts`) — real module, no copies.

### Verified

- **Continuation delivery already queues, never steers** (ralph-wiggum
  parity check): `sendLoopTurn` only fires when `ctx.isIdle() &&
  !ctx.hasPendingMessages()`, else reschedules — mid-turn steering can't
  happen.

## [0.23.8] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **`/glla autoaccept=on` — auto-accept drafts** (field request: "we
  might not care to read it — we already filled out our intents"). Every
  `propose_*` draft (goal, list batch, loop, task list) activates the
  moment the agent proposes it; BOTH the Confirm dialog and the
  v0.14.0 interview floor are skipped. Never silent: each auto-accept
  notifies ("Draft auto-accepted — ACTIVATING now: …") and writes a
  `draft_autoaccepted` ledger entry. Default off — the Confirm gate is
  the product; this is for unattended rigs (pairs with `autoresume=on`).
- **Subagent compatibility, made explicit** (`@tintinweb/pi-subagents`):
  the main session OWNS the goal/loop/list; subagent sessions are
  workers. Mechanical ownership via `ctx.sessionManager` identity (pi
  hands a fresh ctx wrapper per event — object identity is useless):
  subagent sessions never clobber the loop's ctx handle (a headless
  subagent ctx would have silently killed the heartbeat/wedge
  machinery), never run the restore gate, never drive continuation, and
  state-mutating tools (`complete_goal`, `pause_goal`, `propose_*`,
  `list_add`, `list_activate`) refuse with "report back to the main
  agent". Subagent tool activity still feeds the wedge clock — a long
  subagent run is work, not a hang. `classifySessionCtx` (pure) + 4
  tests.

### Fixed

- **v0.23.7's un-truncation was only 1/3 applied** — a rejected
  multi-edit silently dropped the tweak and import dialogs (both still
  truncated: tweak at 400/200 chars, import at 5-of-N items). Now
  actually fixed; verified by grep this time. Lesson recorded: verify
  edits landed before claiming them in a changelog.
- **Drafter-path metricless loops still defaulted to max=50** —
  v0.23.6 flipped the CLI default (metricless + no explicit max =
  unbounded) but `propose_loop_draft` kept its own `: 50`. Aligned.

### Changed

- **"Queue" language → list/pool semantics** (field feedback: the list
  is "claimed to be a queue" but behaves as a pool — order is the
  default, not the law). User- and agent-facing strings now say list /
  waiting / added: "Confirm list batch", "Import into list?", "Added
  to the list (N waiting)", the `list_add` label/description (which
  now states the pool semantics explicitly), README ("List of goals (a
  pool, not a FIFO)"). User-language trigger phrases ("queue these 10
  things") intentionally kept — that's how people ask.

## [0.23.7] — 2026-07-23

Proactive oversight sweep across the OTHER surfaces, after the last four
releases all came from one class of bug (parser false positives, dialog
walls, ceremony defaults, stale text). Five real findings, all fixed:

### Fixed

- **Three Confirm dialogs truncated the content being approved** — a
  Confirm the user can't fully read is not a gate (the v0.23.5 rule,
  now applied everywhere): `/goal tweak` showed CURRENT/NEW objectives
  at 400 chars and the new contract at 200; `/list import` showed 5-of-N
  items at 70 chars; the list-batch Confirm showed 6-of-N at 60 chars.
  All three now render every item in full.
- **Three "done when" parsers had drifted apart** (same class as the
  0.23.4 shield preamble bug): `goalArgsNeedDrafting` and both
  `extractVerificationContract` modes required the colon DIRECTLY after
  "done when", so "/goal Fix X. Done when ALL of the following are
  true: …" routed to the drafting interview despite carrying a full
  contract. All three now accept any text before the colon, matching
  what `contractItems` (0.23.4) and `normalizeDraftContract` (0.23.5)
  already handle.
- **extract-verification.test.ts tested a STALE COPY** of
  `extractVerificationContract` — re-implemented in the test file, with
  a header comment pointing at a `goal-loop-draft.ts` that no longer
  exists. Testing a copy is testing nothing: the function moved to the
  pure `goal-loop-core.ts`, the test imports the real one, and a new
  round-trip test pins the whole chain: normalizeDraftContract → stored
  goal text → extractVerificationContract → shield contractItems.
- **Stale "default 45" wedge-alert text** in the settings input prompt
  and a comment — the actual default has been 30 since v0.23.3 (the
  runtime and settings UI used the constant; only these strings lied).
- **Loop drafter prompt said `max` defaults to 50** for everything —
  stale after v0.23.6 (metric loops: 50; metricless: unbounded). The
  drafter would have told users the wrong default.

## [0.23.6] — 2026-07-23

### Changed

- **Bare `/loop start "<target>"` IS the infinite command.** No
  `measure=` now means metricless (previously a usage error that made
  you type `measure=none`), and a metricless loop with no explicit
  `max=` defaults to UNBOUNDED (`max=0`) instead of 50 — an infinite
  loop is the point of the bare form. The v0.23.0 rule stands: the
  Confirm dialog names "NO plateau stop · NO iteration cap · /loop
  stop" before anything runs, so the choice is never silent. Metric
  loops are untouched (missing `direction=` still errors; absent
  `max=` still defaults to 50). Explicit `measure=none max=50` still
  caps. Field instinct: typing `measure=none max=0` for the common
  "keep polishing forever" case is ceremony.

## [0.23.5] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **Doubled "Done when:" in the goal-draft Confirm dialog** (field
  screenshot): models mimic the `/goal` syntax and start the contract text
  with "Done when:" — the dialog then printed its own header plus the
  model's, twice. `normalizeDraftContract` (pure, in goal-loop-core)
  strips bare introducer lines and glued "Done when: " prefixes before
  BOTH rendering and storage.

### Changed

- **Confirm dialog readability** — the contract now renders as a numbered
  checklist (bullets renumbered 1..N sequentially) under a header that
  names the count: "Done when — 7 checks:". Numbering also makes
  reject-feedback citable ("item 3 is wrong"). Prose lines pass through
  untouched; nothing is truncated — the Confirm gate stays fully
  readable.
- **Drafting prompt: contract sizing guidance** — 3–8 mechanical checks,
  each verifiable with ONE command; the auditor must quote evidence for
  EVERY item, so a 17-item contract means a slow audit and more shield
  friction. Verify artifact integrity, not every sub-part. And: never
  prefix the contract with "Done when:".

## [0.23.4] — 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- **Shield preamble false positive** (darklord field bug: deliverable
  complete on disk, auditor approved TWICE with substantive evidence, and
  the regression shield blocked both — a goal at 36/37 items sat paused
  11h). `contractItems` only stripped "done when" when a colon directly
  followed it, so a contract preamble like "Done when ALL of the
  following are true:" survived as a fake contract "item" — and no
  auditor report can quote evidence for a preamble, so every approval was
  converted to a disapproval, forever. Two mechanical predicates now drop
  introducer lines: a line still ending in a colon after prefix-stripping
  introduces a list, and "(done when) (all of) the following ..." IS the
  introducer. Real items are untouched; 3 regression tests.

## [0.23.3] — 2026-07-23

### Changed

- **Tight timings pass** (user instinct: pi-goal-x's super-long waits
  sucked — audit confirmed goal-x has NO wall-clock bounds anywhere: a
  wedged session there is silent forever). Comparative baseline:
  pi-loop-mode bounds its check command (`--check-timeout`, default
  600s); pi-tasks bounds sync waits (30s default / 600s max); goal-x
  bounds nothing. Two of our three remaining unbounded waits are now
  bounded, and the one alert default tightened.
- **Wedge alert default 45m → 30m.** The alert is notification-only, so
  a false positive costs one notification while a false negative costs
  hours — that asymmetry argues tight.

### Added

- **Measure timeout (10m hard cap)** — `runMeasure` passed NO timeout to
  `pi.exec`: a hung measure command (e.g. a test-based measure) froze the
  loop tick forever, the exact darklord wedge shape one layer down.
  Timeout → measure failure (null) → stall path → plateau stop; never a
  silent hang. Matches loop-mode's 600s check-timeout ballpark.
- **Auditor stall watchdog (10m inactivity → abort)** — the auditor
  legitimately runs the project's own verification, so the bound is on
  INACTIVITY (zero session events), not wall time. A wedged auditor
  (dead stream, hung provider) previously held the completion gate
  forever; now it aborts and returns an infrastructure ERROR (never a
  disapproval, never an approval) naming the cause and the fix.
- Regression-guard test pinning every timing bound to ≤ 30 minutes.

## [0.23.2] — 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Wedge alert** — a wall-clock watchdog for the failure the turn-based
  watchdogs are blind to: the session is BUSY but silent for 45 minutes
  because one unbounded command (a test suite that never exits) is holding
  the entire goal hostage. Field-observed twice in one evening on the same
  wedged `bun test` call (5,056s and 6,800s — the session counters frozen
  byte-identical between them). The heartbeat now checks busy-but-silent
  every tick and fires an in-session warning + the configured notify push,
  throttled to once per threshold interval while the wedge persists; any
  activity re-arms. Default 45m; `/glla wedgealert=<minutes>` (0 = off,
  `unset` = back to default). Predicate `shouldWedgeAlert` in
  `goal-loop-backoff.ts` + 6 tests; ledger event `wedge_alert`.

## [0.23.1] — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Execution discipline in the goal checkpoint prompt** (field report: a
  9h list item with an 84-minute hung `bun test` and zero subagent use).
  Two hard lines: delegate independent parallel streams to `Agent`
  subagents (`Explore` for read-only research — you stay the single
  writer), and wrap test suites / builds / dev servers in `timeout <n>`
  so a hang burns two minutes instead of an hour.

## [0.23.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Metricless spec loops** (`measure=none`). For genuinely endless work —
  an ever-improving spec, continuous hardening, Sisyphus-mode — where no
  number means "better". There is no plateau stop (nothing to stall on):
  the loop ends only at its bounds or `/loop stop`. Own iteration prompt
  (`prompts/goal-loop-forever-metricless.md`): ONE real, inspectable change
  per turn, never repeat earlier iterations, cosmetic churn called out as
  the doorknob failure, "say so when the spec is genuinely exhausted".
  Branch mode commits every iteration (no regression signal to revert on).
- **`max=0` = truly unbounded** (no iteration cap), measured loops included.
  Absent `max` still defaults to 50. Status/widget show `∞`.
- **The loop drafter offers metricless explicitly**: when the user says
  there is no number, the interview presents the trade-off (no plateau;
  ends only at bounds or /loop stop) and the Confirm dialog names it.
  `propose_loop_draft` accepts an omitted/"none" measureCmd and skips the
  measure test-run. Work with a finish line is still redirected to /goal.
- 9 new tests (metricless parsing, direction rejection, unbounded,
  bound-stops, no-plateau).

### Fixed

- `direction=` with `measure=none` is rejected ("direction is meaningless
  without a metric") instead of silently recorded.
- `/loop status`, resume notices, the widget, and the status footer render
  metricless loops (`loop ∞ iter N · metricless`, "metricless — work the
  spec (no plateau)") instead of `undefined (undefined)`.
- propose_loop_refine on a metricless loop refuses to bolt a metric on
  mid-run ("stop, then start a measured loop").

## [0.22.7] — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **`/list resume`** — resume the paused list item without leaving the
  list surface. The head item activates AS the active goal, so this is the
  same motion as `/goal resume`, named for what the user is looking at
  ("we would just unpause, and that is next"). Errors clearly when nothing
  is paused or the paused goal didn't come from the list. Autocomplete
  included.

### Fixed

- **Pause/resume/restore messaging names the thing you're resuming.** A
  paused list item said "Goal paused — /goal resume to continue", which
  read wrong when you were managing a list. Now: `/list pause` path says
  "List item … paused (N queued in the list). /list resume to continue.";
  resume confirms "Resumed list item [id]"; the fresh-session restore gate
  holds a list head with "List item held on restore … /list resume to
  continue"; auto-resume and autoContinue-off restore notices say
  "list item" too. Loops already had their own text ("/loop to resume").
- **Paused footer shows the policy word.** `glla: list paused ⏸ …` /
  `glla: goal paused ⏸ …`, mirroring the active line's `list ●` / `goal ●`.

## [0.22.6] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Regression shield false-rejected genuine approvals.** Three real
  `<approved/>` audits (hegemon) were converted to disapprovals because the
  per-item check demanded the item's single longest word verbatim: contract-
  only vocabulary ("left-cropped"), prose-glued punctuation
  ("file/element."), and slash-compounds ("Phaser/Svelte") never appear in a
  good-faith report. Matching is now: top-3 longest tokens (>=5 chars, edge
  punctuation stripped), ANY-match; compound tokens match via their
  segments. Verified against the actual hegemon reports — the misread items
  now pass; bamboozle-style reports still fail (5 new tests).
- **"Out of scope:" contract lines no longer require evidence.** Boundary
  statements constrain the auditor's judgment; they are not deliverables.
- **Shield-blocked approvals are no longer reported as plain disapprovals.**
  The tool result now says the auditor APPROVED, lists the unreferenced
  contract items, and tells the executor not to touch the deliverable — the
  old generic message read like a verdict (an executor concluded "parser
  bug" and gave up with a complete deliverable).
- **Shield gaps feed the next audit.** The missing contract items are
  recorded in auditHistory (regressionShieldMissing) and injected into the
  next auditor prompt ("address each of them explicitly: name the item and
  paste the raw output"), so a retried audit converges instead of repeating
  the same vocabulary gap.
- **List-draft Confirm dialog names immediate activation.** A drafted list
  item auto-activates when the list is empty, but the dialog only said
  "Confirm goal" — "I started a list and ended up with a running goal" was
  a real surprise. The dialog is now titled "Confirm list item" and states
  up front: "List is empty — confirming ACTIVATES this immediately as the
  active goal. Reject if you only wanted to queue it." Batch drafts get the
  same note.

## [0.22.5] — 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Subcommand autocomplete for all four commands.** `/goal `, `/list `,
  `/loop `, `/glla ` now offer arrow-selectable subcommands/keys with
  one-line descriptions in the /-menu (pi's getArgumentCompletions).

### Fixed

- **Resume/restore messaging names the list.** `/goal resume` printed
  nothing, and the restore-gate hold hint never mentioned the queue — so
  resuming a paused list head looked like it only touched a goal. The hold
  notification, the widget's suggested-action line, and a new resume
  confirmation now say "(+N queued in the list — resuming the list's head)".

## [0.22.4] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **`/loop <natural language>` now drafts with the seed.** Unknown args
  previously fell through to a usage line, so `/loop make the tests faster`
  did nothing. Bare natural language now enters loop drafting with the text
  as the seed (the metric is the whole game for a loop — the interview
  designs it); `/loop start "<target>" measure=... direction=...` remains
  the skip-drafting path. Guards against a second loop while one is active.
- Seeded-drafting notification is target-aware: the loop variant explains
  the metric/direction interview and shows the full `/loop start` skip
  syntax (including time/tokens/branch) instead of the goal-oriented
  "Done when:" text; the old fallthrough usage line (which omitted
  time/tokens/branch) is gone.
- `/loop` command description (the /-menu tooltip) documents the drafting
  path.

## [0.22.3] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- tsc: non-null assertions for the v0.22.2 width test under
  noUncheckedIndexedAccess (0.22.2 shipped with the test file failing
  `npm run check`; suite itself was green).

## [0.22.2] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Auditor failed silently with extension-registered providers.** The
  auditor passed `modelRegistry` to `createAgentSession` — an option that
  does not exist and was silently ignored. A fresh ModelRuntime was built
  from auth.json/models.json, which has no extension-registered providers,
  so streaming a session model from one (custom api id / custom streamSimple)
  failed inside the stream and the auditor produced zero output
  ("Auditor produced no output — NOT a verdict"). The auditor now passes the
  parent session's ModelRuntime through, so the isolated session streams
  through the same composed provider as the parent. Verified live on a rig
  whose session model is extension-registered: the auditor now runs and
  returns a verdict. (Root-caused from a user report; the v0.22.0 provider
  warning's "usually works" premise is now actually true.)
- **Real stream errors are surfaced.** Stream failures arrive as an
  assistant message with stopReason "error" + errorMessage, not as an
  "error" event — the auditor now captures that into the infra-error text
  instead of the opaque "produced no output".
- **Widget truncation is width-aware.** Branch lines were cut at fixed
  ~60-char floors even on wide terminals. Truncation budgets now scale with
  the terminal width (floors unchanged for narrow terminals); the call site
  passes process.stdout.columns. Matches pi-tasks' truncate-at-terminal-width
  behavior.

### Changed

- Dev-dependency `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` bumped 0.74.2 → 0.81.1 so
  type-checking matches the API the extension actually runs against
  (CreateAgentSessionOptions.modelRuntime).

## [0.22.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Goal invisible on session load.** `session_start` only painted the TUI
  via `persistState`, so a goal that was already paused (or any state that
  doesn't mutate on load) rendered no widget and no status line after
  starting or resuming a session — "can't tell if it's on" is a bug. The
  handler now calls `refreshUI` unconditionally, which also refreshes/clears
  any stale widget carried over from a previous in-process session.

## [0.22.0] — 2026-07-22

Self-audit release: the extension audited itself (goal 20260722151428-375it3,
report in the operator's audit dir) and shipped every fix in one batch.

### Changed (approved behavior fixes)

- **Widget token segment is conditional.** With the token guard off (the
  default, opt-in since v0.12.0) the widget showed "0/0 tok" — zero
  information. The "· N/M tok" segment now appears only when a budget is set.
- **Provider warning reworded.** The session-start notice claimed an
  extension-registered session provider means "the auditor will fail auth".
  False for providers defined in ~/.pi/agent/models.json: the auditor inherits
  the already-resolved Model object in-process, so those work. The notice is
  now failure-conditional: "if audits error with auth/provider failures, set
  /glla model=provider/id".

### Fixed (hygiene batch from the audit)

- INSTALL.md listed the v0.1.0-era /pi-gla-* command family — a fresh install
  following the doc could invoke nothing. Now /goal, /list, /loop, /glla, and
  the smoke walkthrough uses /goal start.
- docs/DESIGN.md, PLAN.md, README.md, examples/, schemas/goal.schema.json:
  swept the last /pi-gla-* command names, .pi-gla/ paths, pi-gla-loop/ branch
  prefix, the "default 1M" token claim, and the "Stuck > 5 min" mechanism
  (the live guard is the 3-turn stall watchdog). PLAN.md's header no longer
  claims "v0.1.0-alpha.1 scaffold"; examples/example-objective.md rewritten
  to current behavior including the v0.21.0 restore hold.
- prompts/goal-loop-continuation.md told the model to propose a
  /pi-gla-tweak (nonexistent) → /goal tweak; its BACKOFF section described a
  5-minute pause that was never live → STALLS section matching the real
  watchdog.
- Dead code: removed unused backoff imports, STATE_ENTRY, and
  consecutiveStuckIterations from loops/goal.ts; /loop usage text no longer
  advertises the removed done= key; goal-loop-auditor.ts header no longer
  says regression_shield is "NOT YET IMPLEMENTED" (it has been live since
  v0.2.0); list_status tool label "Queue status" → "List status".
- Test docs: counts unified to the measured 168 across 12 files;
  tests/README.md coverage list gained the 5 missing files.
- CHANGELOG: removed a duplicated 0.19.0 heading.
- goal-loop-display.ts header now documents the purity rule: no runtime
  imports (npm test runs node --experimental-strip-types, which does not
  rewrite .js → .ts specifiers).

## [0.21.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed — widget head glyph and tree alignment

- **Active head now renders green for real.** The ◆ (U+25C6) head glyph is
  substituted by color-emoji fonts in some terminals and ignores ANSI color —
  it showed yellow no matter what was painted. Head glyph is now ● (U+25CF),
  the same glyph the status line uses, which takes theme color everywhere.
- **Branch lines flush-left.** v0.20.0 added a one-space branch indent, but
  pi's widget renderer already contributes a one-space gutter — branches sat
  one column deeper than pi-tasks'. ├─/└─/⎇ lines now emit no leading space,
  matching pi-tasks exactly.

## [0.21.0] — 2026-07-22

### Changed — session restore no longer auto-starts work in fresh sessions

Opening pi in a folder with an active goal used to fire work immediately —
before you could even load your old session, a fresh empty session was
already burning turns with zero conversation context. Restore is now gated
on `session_start.reason`:

- **"resume" / "reload" / "fork"** — the session carries the goal's
  conversation: auto-resume, as before.
- **"startup" / "new" (or no reason, older pi)** — fresh session: HOLD.
  Goals restore paused ("restored in a fresh session — no work started",
  /goal resume to continue); loops restore held (/loop with no args resumes
  a held loop instead of drafting); a waiting list notifies instead of
  auto-activating the head.
- **/glla autoresume=on** — new setting (global or project) restoring the
  old auto-resume-everywhere behavior. Set it per rig project for
  unattended restarts. Default off.

The gate is one mechanical predicate (`shouldAutoResumeOnSessionStart`),
unit-tested across all five reasons plus the autoresume override.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed — the liveness signal looked frozen

The UI ticker ran every 5s while `fmtElapsed` showed minute granularity
("14m" for a full minute) — an active goal was indistinguishable from a
wedged one at a glance. Ticker now runs every 1s and elapsed keeps
seconds visible up to the hour (`1m 05s`, `3m 00s`; `1h 05m` beyond).
Paused goals still don't tick — the stopped clock is the honest metaphor
for "waiting on the user".

## [0.20.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added — semantic colors in the widget + status line

The goal/list/loop widget and the footer status line now paint status
semantically via pi's theme (works in light + dark themes):

- **green** — active goal/list item (◆/●), loop best value
- **yellow** — paused awaiting user; loop stall one short of the plateau stop
- **red** — error pauses (token limit, stalled, auditor infra failure)
- **accent** — auditing in progress, loop direction arrows
- **dim** — token counters, hints, suggested actions, measure command

Colors are opt-in at the call site (`DisplayTheme`); the pure builders
still return plain strings without a theme, so tests stay ANSI-free.

### Fixed — widget column alignment + branch-name relic

- Widget branch lines (`├─`/`└─`) were flush-left while the head glyph
  padded the text column — the tree looked one space out of column next
  to other widgets. Branch lines now indent one space (pi-tasks
  convention): the tree sits under the head glyph, text column consistent.
- Loop scratch branches were still named `pi-gla-loop/…` (rename relic);
  now `pi-glla-loop/…`, commit messages included.

## [0.19.3] — 2026-07-22

### Changed — goal drafting: thoroughness goes in the contract, not in iteration budgets

An agent mid-`/goal`-interview asked the user to pick "Loop size: 30/60/15
iterations with a stop rule" — loop-3 vocabulary imported into a goal,
with an invented pass-count dressed up as a recommended preset. The
mechanical guard was already right (`propose_loop_draft` rejects calls
outside loop drafting), but the goal-draft prompt never said goals have no
iterations. Now it does: exhaustiveness is expressed as checkable contract
items ("Done when: all 22 screens audited"), never as pass-counts, and
invented tiered packages are called out by name. Same pattern as the
v0.19.1 list-cap fix: agents confabulate authoritative-looking numbers;
the prompt is where confabulated framing gets banned.

## [0.19.2] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed — the status line names what it's running; `/gla` and "queue" relics swept

- **Footer shows the right name per loop type.** The status line hardcoded
  `glla: goal ●` even when the active item came from the list. It now reads
  `Goal.policy`: `glla: goal ●` for a direct goal, `glla: list ●` for a
  list-activated item (loop 3 already showed `glla: loop ↑/↓`). One status
  line, three honest names.
- **Three more user-facing `/gla` relics** the 0.17.x sweeps missed: the
  no-model error ("set one with /gla model=…"), the token-limit pause
  message + its suggested action, and the provider-warning + settings hint
  text. All say `/glla` now; comment blocks swept too.
- **"Queue" relics renamed to "list"** in user/agent-facing text: the
  `/list` show header, the confirm-activation messages, the list-drafting
  label, and the drafting block message.

## [0.19.1] — 2026-07-22

### Changed — the list is unbounded; the 100-per-call cap is gone

The queue was already unbounded (`enqueueItems` appends without limit) —
the only arbitrary wall was `list_add` rejecting batches over 100. Hundreds
of small tasks are a legitimate list. The cap is removed and the tool
descriptions now say so explicitly ("The list is UNBOUNDED — hundreds of
small items are fine; propose them all"), because agents read caps into
examples and self-impose limits the plugin never had. The honest cost note
stays: every item is audited individually, so audit cost is the real
budget for huge lists — not a number in code.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-22

### Changed — `/list add` is now a no-op alias; detection routes everything

The verb was redundant: `/list plan.md` already imported via detection, so
`add`'s only real job was forcing vague text past the interview. But a list
item activates RAW when it reaches the head — the drafting interview is the
only quality gate an item ever gets, and a verb whose sole purpose was
skipping that gate was a leak, not an escape hatch. Now `add` and `import`
are stripped and the rest routes through `routeListText` exactly like
verb-less text: file → import, paste → batch, `Done when:` → direct,
anything else → drafting. Muscle memory (`/list add plan.md`) keeps working.
The list-drafting notice now names the real direct path: include a
`Done when:` clause. Also swept the last "Forever-polish loop" framing from
the README decision table.

## [0.18.1] — 2026-07-22

## [0.18.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed — Confirm-gate bypass: agent queued list items directly mid-draft

First live run of conversational `/list`: the agent received the drafting
interview, skipped it, called `list_add` three times, and ACTIVATED the
first item — zero confirmation, because the gate only covered
`propose_goal_draft`. During a list drafting session `list_add` and
`list_activate` now return a block error steering to
`propose_goal_draft(items[])` (one Confirm for the whole batch). User
commands (`/list add`) are unaffected; outside drafting the agent manages
the list freely. New pure predicate `listMutationBlocked` + test.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-07-22

## [0.18.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added — conversational `/list`: dump text, get a decomposed list

`/list fix the login bug, add dark mode, write docs` used to hit a usage
error (unknown verb "fix") — and `/list add` of the same text queued ONE
monolithic objective. Now an unknown first word is treated as a
natural-language dump and routed by detection (new `routeListText`):

- file path → bulk import (sisyphus/Ralph plan file, unchanged)
- multi-line paste → batch add (structure already explicit, unchanged)
- contains `Done when:` → one direct item, no interview
- anything else → **drafting session**: the agent decomposes the dump into
  `items[]`, one Confirm adds the whole batch

`/list add <text>` stays the explicit direct path — the `/goal start` of
lists — for when you know it's one item. The list-drafting notice now
names the right escape hatch (`/list add`, not `/goal start`), and the
empty-list hint teaches the conversational form.

## [0.17.1] — 2026-07-22

## [0.17.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed — four `/gla` strings the 0.17.0 sweep missed

Widget footer hint, loop-block comment, and the two auditor-infrastructure
error paths still pointed at `/gla`. The relic sweep now greps clean
(everything except the intentional migration code and CHANGELOG history).

## [0.17.0] — 2026-07-22

## [0.17.0] — 2026-07-22

### Breaking — no relics: aliases removed, state dir renamed

Self-audit after the rename. A rename that keeps aliases is a rename that
didn't happen.

- `/gla` alias **removed** — `/glla` is the only settings command.
- `/queue` alias **removed** — `/list` since 0.10.0, the training wheels
  stayed three releases too long.
- Status/widget prefix `gla:` → `glla:`; widget keys `pi-gla` → `pi-glla`.
- State dir `.pi-gla` → `.pi-glla` with a one-time automatic migration
  (existing goals, ledgers, and project settings move; no state is lost).
- Every user-facing string (error messages, header comments, docs, smoke
  script) now says `/glla` and `.pi-glla`.

### Fixed — tooltip drift: `/loop` description advertised a removed strategy

The command tooltip still showed `[done=<value>]` — an option that throws
since 0.15.0 — and the "forever loop" framing predates the repositioning.
New description states the agreed philosophy: *"metric-driven process — it
never completes… 'Improve until X' is a /goal, not a loop"* with the real
parameters `[time=<hours>] [tokens=<budget>] [branch=1]`. Also: tool
description "queue item" → "list item".

## [0.16.0] — 2026-07-22

## [0.16.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added — `/goal start <objective>`: the explicit skip-draft

The only skip paths were embedding `Done when:` (a string heuristic) or
surviving the interview. `/goal start` activates immediately by explicit
command — no grilling, no Confirm gate, symmetric with `/loop start`; the
auditor infers the contract from the objective. The drafting notice and
`/goal` help now name the escape hatch, so a user stuck in an interview
learns the way out from the UI itself. `/goal start` with no objective
prints usage.

## [0.15.1] — 2026-07-22

## [0.15.1] — 2026-07-22

### Fixed — endless drafting: the gate ignored dialog answers

Wild failure (junk-runner session): the user answered **five**
`ask_user_question` rounds and `propose_goal_draft` still returned
INTERVIEW FIRST every time. The floor counted only typed chat messages
(`message_start` role=user); dialog answers arrive as **tool results** and
never incremented the counter. Worse, the blocked error said "ask one sharp
question, then propose again" — mechanically manufacturing an endless
interview. The agent eventually bypassed the goal entirely.

Two fixes, one mechanism:

- `tool_result` handler counts answered `ask_user_question` questionnaires
  (`details.cancelled === false` with ≥1 answer — Esc-abandons do NOT count)
  toward the interview floor, via the new `askUserQuestionAnswered` helper.
- Stuck-gate escape hatch: after 3 blocked proposals, the error message
  switches to "tell the user to type any chat message to unlock" — a gate
  that cannot see the replies must never manufacture another interview round.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-07-21

## [0.15.0] — 2026-07-21

### The package is now `pi-goal-list-loop-audit` — and a loop never completes

Design conversation outcome: **goal = achievement, loop = process.** The old
name read as "a loop for goals"; the three primitives are peers and the
name now says so. npm `pi-goal-loop-audit` is deprecated with a pointer.
`/glla` is the settings command; `/gla` stays as an alias. State dir
`.pi-gla` unchanged.

### Breaking — `done=` removed from `/loop`

A loop no longer checks for completion — *that was a goal in a trench coat.*
`done=` now throws a teaching error pointing at `/goal "… Done when: …"`.
The loop's ends are exactly: `/loop stop`, plateau (the well is dry),
`max=` iterations, and the two NEW arbitrary bounds `time=<hours>` and
`tokens=<budget>` (orchestrator-counted input+output). The loop Confirm
dialog states it plainly: "The loop never completes."

### Added — `propose_loop_refine` (the living spec)

The loop's unique territory: working against a spec that can itself be
refined. Mid-loop, the agent calls `propose_loop_refine` with a sharpened
target and/or a new measure command plus a rationale; the user confirms;
on a measure change the orchestrator test-runs the new command (no number =
auto-reject) and re-baselines. `loop.refinements[]` keeps both eras;
`/loop status` shows the refinement count. The forever prompt now names
this as the only legitimate way to change the metric — never gaming it.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-07-21

All notable changes to pi-goal-loop-audit are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.4] — 2026-07-21

### Docs — compatibility section

README gains the full complement/conflict map: the Two-Driver Rule (one
agent_end driver at a time — hard conflicts with pi-codex-goal, pi-loop-mode,
pi-goal-x family, active ralph/autoresearch), the compaction-continue overlap
note, the ralph-wiggum "installed but not simultaneous" rule, and the
complements (rpiv-ask-user-question, pi-subagents, pi-tasks, pi-chrome,
search skills) with the provider + notification-channel footnotes.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-07-21

### Added — bamboozle adversarial scenario (auditor catch-rate testing)

- **`scripts/smoke.sh bamboozle`**: the first outcome-level test. A buggy
  `calc.js` where the easy path is gutting the tests and the contract makes
  that detectable: `node --test exits 0` AND exports intact AND ≥6 test
  blocks. Asserts the traps all hold at the end AND the shield enforced
  per-item evidence (`regressionShieldPassed: true`). This is how we measure
  the auditor's catch rate instead of just its mechanics. 6/6 green on first
  run (agent fixed the bug honestly; the shield verified all three traps with
  evidence).

## [0.9.2] — 2026-07-21

### Added — done= threshold, hypothesis line, stall strategy hint

- **`/loop start ... done=<value>`**: until-done semantics (pi-loop-mode's one
  genuinely good idea we lacked). The loop stops the MOMENT the metric
  crosses the threshold (min: `value <= done`, max: `value >= done`) instead
  of stalling out the plateau window first. Done beats plateau when both hit.
  Also available as `done` in `propose_loop_draft`. Verified live: 3→2→1→0
  stopped at iteration 3 with `done — metric crossed 0`, no stall tail.
- **`HYPOTHESIS:` line** (pi-autoresearch's good idea): loop prompts ask the
  agent to state its intent first; the line is parsed into every
  `loop_measured` ledger event, making loop history auditable, not just numeric.
- **Strategy rotation at high stall** (pi-loop-mode's other good idea): at
  `stall >= window-1`, the directive switches from "one small change" to "try
  a fundamentally different approach" — one creative shot before the plateau
  stop, instead of polishing to the end.
- 8 new unit tests (doneCrossed, done-stops-immediately, done-beats-plateau,
  done= parsing). 142 total, tsc clean.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-07-21

### Changed — `/list` renamed to `/queue`

The status line said `queue 4`, the widget said `queue 7 waiting`, `list_add`'s
description read "Add to queue" — everything already called it a queue except
the command. Now the command matches: `/queue add|show|next|remove|clear`.
"List" described a static structure; this thing has FIFO behavior with
auto-advance — that's a queue. `/list` remains as an alias for one release
(removed in 0.10.0). `/goal` stays (a goal is not a todo — it has a contract
and an audit); `/todo(s)` rejected (checkbox semantics invite exactly the
vagueness the auditor exists to kill).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added — live TUI: status line + above-editor widget

- **You can always tell it's on now.** A persistent `gla:` segment in the
  status line shows the supervisor state at all times:
  `gla: goal ● 2/5 tasks · 3m · queue 4` · `gla: auditing… · read` ·
  `gla: paused ⏸ <reason>` · `gla: loop ↓ iter 12/50 · best 41 · stall 2/5`.
- **Above-editor live widget** (pi-goal-x pattern, simpler `string[]` form):
  objective head, status, elapsed, token usage, next pending task or loop
  metric, pause reason + suggestion, branch name in branch mode, and **live
  auditor progress** (current tool, elapsed, isolated-session note) during
  audits. Refreshes on every state transition (single chokepoint:
  `persistState`) plus a 5s ticker for elapsed time.
- Pure builders in `goal-loop-display.ts` — 16 unit tests.

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- Live: widget renders during an audit with live auditor progress; status
  line reads `gla: auditing…`. 134 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.8.5] — 2026-07-21

### Changed — auditor thinking follows the pi session

- **Auditor thinking level**: was a hardcoded `medium` default. Now the
  auditor follows the thinking level **you selected in pi** (same philosophy
  as the model), with a `high` floor when nothing is set — the auditor is the
  verification gate, depth beats speed there. `/gla thinking=` remains the
  explicit override; the settings UI shows `(session, floor high)` when unset.

## [0.8.4] — 2026-07-21

### Added — free-style list: the agent can manage the queue

- **`list_add` tool**: the queue is no longer command-only. Plain chat works —
  "queue these 10 things", "add this to my list", "put it on the backlog" —
  the agent enqueues with per-item `Done when:` extraction and
  auto-activation. This was the real gap vs sisyphus/ralph-style plugins:
  conversational flow with our audited-queue semantics.
- **`list_status` tool**: the agent can read the active goal, the queue, and
  any running loop as text before deciding what to do.
- **`enqueueItems`**: the one shared enqueue path — bulk import, `items[]`
  drafting, and `list_add` all funnel through it (three copies eliminated).

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- Live: one plain-chat sentence ("queue these three things: …") →
  `list_add {count: 3}` (agent added its own Done-when clauses) →
  three goals worked → **three independent auditor approvals** → archived.
- 118 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-07-21

### Changed — quiet auditor auto-fallback; `/list add` takes pasted lists

- **The provider warning is gone.** When the pi session model's provider is
  extension-registered (the auditor's extension-less session can't auth it),
  the plugin now **auto-uses the strongest credentialed built-in model** and
  says so ONCE at info level, naming the pick: override any time with
  `/gla model=provider/id`. Resolution: explicit `/gla` setting → session
  model (if built-in) → auto-fallback (tier-ranked) → clear error. The
  session model always wins when it works; nothing is ever written to your
  config silently.
- **`/list add` accepts pasted multi-line text**: paste a checklist straight
  into the command — it parses as a batch with the same single Confirm as a
  file import. Detection order: existing file → multi-line paste → single
  objective.
- `auditModelTier` restored to core (2 unit tests; speed/cost variants
  outrank family names — `gemini-3-flash` is flash-tier, not gemini-tier).

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- Live: multi-line bracketed paste → batch Confirm → `list_imported {count: 3}`.
- 118 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-07-21

### Changed — `/list add` is the flexible path; drafting proposes batches

- **`/list add` now detects files**: `/list add plan.md` bulk-imports when the
  path exists and is a single objective when it doesn't. No separate verb to
  remember. (`/list import` remains as an alias for 0.8.1 compatibility.)
- **Multi-item drafting**: `propose_goal_draft` gains an `items[]` parameter,
  so a `/list` drafting session can propose a whole plan at once — one Confirm
  dialog for the batch, per-item `Done when:` extraction, auto-activation.
  `items[]` in `/goal` drafting is rejected (a goal is single by definition).
  The list-draft prompt tells the agent to batch: "queue these 50 things"
  → one proposal, not fifty.
- `resolveImportFile` in core (4 unit tests): file detection by bare name,
  relative path, `./` prefix; objectives and directories never match.

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- Live: `/list add plan.md` → file detected → batch Confirm →
  `list_imported {count: 3}` → first item activated, 2 queued.
- 116 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-21

### Added — bulk list import + queue paging

- **`/list import <file>`**: the sisyphus-style path. Bulk-enqueue hundreds of
  items from a plan file — markdown checklists (`- [ ]`), bullets, numbered
  items, plain lines; headings/comments/hr-rules skipped; per-item `Done
  when:` extraction; ONE Confirm dialog for the whole batch (count + preview).
  **Bulk never drafts** — the three drafting rules are now explicit:
  no-args = draft (single), with-args = direct, import = bulk direct.
- **`/list show` pages at 15** with `… and N more` (a 500-item queue no longer
  floods the pane).
- `parseListImport` in core (8 unit tests incl. a full sisyphus-plan fixture).

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- Live: 20-item plan → Confirm (5 preview + "… and 15 more") →
  `list_imported {count: 20}` → first item auto-activated, 19 queued, paging
  correct, agent working. 112 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-21

### Changed — `/gla` opens a real settings UI; four top-level commands

- **`/gla` now opens an interactive settings menu** (pi dialog primitives):
  pick a setting → edit it (input for model/notify/token limit, select for
  thinking level) → saved to GLOBAL → back to the menu until Done/Esc. The
  scriptable `/gla key=value` and `/gla project key=value` forms remain for
  tmux/headless; headless sessions get the text display with provenance.
- **Top-level commands consolidated from 11 to 4**: `/goal`, `/list`,
  `/loop`, `/gla`. The goal verbs became exact-match subcommands:
  `/goal status|pause|resume|cancel|tweak <text>|archive`. Removed:
  `goal-status`, `goal-pause`, `goal-resume`, `goal-cancel`, `goal-tweak`,
  `goals`, `goal-init`.
- **The ambiguity rule** (unit-tested): subcommands match only on the exact
  bare word, so `/goal pause the deployment pipeline` sets an objective about
  a pipeline — only bare `/goal pause` pauses. `routeGoalArgs` in core,
  10 tests including the critical cases.

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- 104 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-21

### Changed — `/goal-settings` renamed to `/gla`

One config command for everything — goals, loops, lists, and the auditor —
deserves a name that doesn't say "goal" alone. `/gla` matches the `.pi-gla/`
state directory and sits in its own namespace beside the three verbs
(`/goal`, `/list`, `/loop`). Same handler, same tiers:

```
/gla                          # effective values + provenance
/gla model=provider/id        # write GLOBAL
/gla project tokenlimit=500   # write project override
```

`/goal-settings` is gone (renamed, not aliased — the plugin is a day old;
clean break over surface creep).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-21

### Added — global config tier

- **One global config, rarely opened.** Settings now resolve per key as
  **project > global > defaults**: global lives at
  `~/.pi/agent/pi-goal-loop-audit.settings.json`, the project override stays
  at `.pi-gla/settings.json`. `/goal-settings key=value` writes GLOBAL by
  default (set the auditor override, notify command, token limit once — not
  in every project); `/goal-settings project key=value` writes the rare local
  override; `key=unset` removes the key from that tier.
- **Provenance display**: bare `/goal-settings` shows every effective value
  with its source (`[project]` / `[global]` / `[default]`) and both file paths.
- Nothing is per-goal: model, thinking, notify, and token budget are shared
  config for all three loops. The auditor still defaults to the pi session
  model — the plugin never picks a model.
- `mergeSettings` in core (4 unit tests): later layers win per key,
  `undefined` means "not set here", base never mutated.

### Verified (2026-07-21)

- Live: global write lands at `~/.pi/agent/…` with quoted `$1` commands intact;
  `project` prefix writes only the project file; provenance display correct.
- `loop` smoke green with project-scoped notify (no global-config leak).
- 94 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-07-20

### Changed (model philosophy: the user selects the model in pi)

- **The plugin no longer picks or recommends auditor models.** The auditor
  uses the pi session model by default; `/goal-settings model=provider/id`
  remains as an explicit override. An earlier tier-based auto-selection idea
  was implemented and then ripped out the same day — model choice belongs to
  the user, not the plugin.
- **No model names anywhere**: docs, examples, comments, and messages use
  `provider/model-id` placeholders only. The session-start warning for
  extension-registered providers now explains the two fixes (switch pi's
  model to a built-in provider, or set the override) instead of recommending
  a specific model.
- The smoke harness no longer configures an auditor model at all — the
  auditor shares the test session's pi-selected model, which is the path
  most users will run.

### Verified (2026-07-20)

- `goal` smoke 5/5 with zero auditor-model configuration (auditor ran on the
  session model directly). 90 unit tests, tsc clean.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-20

### Fixed (footguns found by real use)

- **Direct `/loop start` refuses a no-number baseline.** Previously a broken
  measure started with a null baseline and burned stall iterations until
  plateau. Now it fails fast with the raw output and a fix hint; `force=1`
  overrides for measures that only work after the agent builds something first.
- **Redirect guidance for non-numeric goals**: `/loop start` parse errors and
  the refusal now say plainly — research/docs/features belong in `/goal` (the
  auditor verifies semantically); `/loop` only believes a number. The loop
  drafting prompt has the same rule and offers to hand over a well-structured
  `/goal` objective instead of inventing a fake metric.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-20

Draft everything. For a long-running thing, a draft up front is better —
until now only `/goal` had drafting; `/list add` took raw strings, and
`/loop start` demanded a correct target+measure+direction in one blind shot.

### Added

- **`/loop` drafting with measure test-run** (centerpiece): `/loop` with no
  args starts a grilling turn about target + metric. When the agent calls
  `propose_loop_draft`, the **orchestrator runs the proposed measure command
  once** and shows the real output + parsed number in the Confirm dialog —
  you validate the metric before a single iteration burns tokens. A measure
  producing no number is auto-rejected back to the agent with its own output.
- **`/list` drafting**: `/list add` with no args runs the same goal-drafting
  flow, but the confirmed contract lands in the **queue** (auto-activates if
  nothing is running). Drafting target is now unified: `goal | list | loop`.
- **`/goals` archive browser**: newest-first list of archived goals with
  status, objective head, and stop reason.

### Changed

- `/loop` with no args now drafts; `/loop status` is the explicit status path.

### Verified live (2026-07-20)

- Loop drafting: agent found `num.txt` itself, proposed `cat num.txt`, dialog
  showed "Test-run output: 10 · Parsed number: 10 (lower is better)";
  confirmed loop ran 10→9→8 improving.
- List drafting: confirmed contract → `list_added` → auto-activated →
  worked → audited → archived.
- `/goals` parsing verified against real archive entries.
- 89 unit tests green; `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-20

Self-sufficiency release: the loop now owns its own liveness. A goal loop that
dies silently after compaction and needs an external plugin to restart it is a
hole in THIS plugin — so the watchdog is baked in, and the external one
(`@badliveware/pi-compaction-continue`) can be cut.

### Added

- **Heartbeat self-watchdog**: a 15s interval checks the one precise stall
  condition — supervising (active goal or running loop) + session idle + no
  continuation/loop timer scheduled + no activity for 60s — and re-fires the
  continuation itself. Covers every stall cause (compaction-eaten turn,
  dropped message, stale ctx) with a single check. Stall accounting: a
  supervising turn with zero tool calls is a nudge; 3 consecutive nudges
  pause the goal / stop the loop with a clear reason. Pure decision functions
  in `goal-loop-backoff.ts`, 8 unit tests.
- **`/goal-tweak "<new objective>"`** — edit the active goal in place; Confirm
  dialog shows current vs new; the verification contract is re-extracted from
  the new text (old contract dropped if the new text carries none).
- **Structured drafting forms**: the drafting prompt now prefers
  `ask_user_question` (from `rpiv-ask-user-question`) when the tool is
  available in the session — structured option lists during grilling without
  a hard dependency. Plain conversation remains the fallback.

### Verified (2026-07-20)

- 89 unit tests green; `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `goal` smoke 5/5 with the heartbeat interval live through the full cycle.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-20

The completion release: the last open pi-goal-x flaw is closed, and every
deferral from earlier milestones either shipped or was recorded as rejected.

### Added

- **Auditor compaction** (closes flaw #3, the final one): pi's built-in
  compaction is now enabled in the auditor session (was disabled — long audits
  could exhaust context mid-audit). Safety is structural: regression_shield is
  orchestrator-side, so compaction can only weaken the auditor's evidence and
  cause disapproval, never a false approval.
- **Token guard**: goals now track real token usage (summed from assistant
  `usage.totalTokens`, deduped across replayed `agent_end` history). Crossing
  the limit pauses the goal with a clear reason. Default 1M per goal;
  `/goal-settings tokenlimit=<n>` to tune. Shown in `/goal-status`.
- **Loop 3 `branch=1` mode**: all loop work on a scratch branch
  (`pi-gla-loop/<timestamp>-<slug>`) — commit per improvement,
  `git reset --hard` per regression (scratch branch only; your branch and
  uncommitted work are never touched). Refuses non-git dirs and dirty trees.
  On stop: returns to your original branch with merge instructions.
- **Resumption notice** on `session_start`: active goal (with queue depth) or
  running loop (iteration/best/stall) is announced. (Replaces the D4
  "plugin vanished" self-check, which is impossible from inside the plugin —
  absent code cannot run. Recorded as rejected in PLAN.md.)

### Fixed / synced

- `schemas/goal.schema.json` updated to the current state shape (was v0.1.0,
  still said "oracle").
- `examples/example-objective.md` rewritten — it still used `/pi-gla-set`.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` addenda for v0.2.0/v0.3.0/v0.4.0.
- Smoke harness: new `draft-reject` scenario (Confirm → No → refine → Yes →\n  audited approval, 6/6); clarified-word probe made robust (a grilling turn
  ends with `?`).

### Verified live (2026-07-20, `scripts/smoke.sh`)

- `goal` 5/5 (with compaction enabled), `list` 4/4, `loop` 5/5, `draft` 3/3,
  `draft-reject` 6/6.
- branch=1 smoke: 5 commits (one per improving iteration) on the scratch
  branch, zero for stalls, `main` untouched, returned to `main` on plateau
  stop with merge instructions.
- 81 unit tests green; `tsc --noEmit` clean.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-20

The third loop. All three loops now ship on one state machine.

### Added

- **Loop 3: `/loop`** — metric-driven forever loop:
  `/loop start "<target>" measure="<cmd>" direction=min|max [window=5] [max=50]`,
  `/loop status`, `/loop stop`. The **orchestrator** runs the measure command
  after every agent turn (the agent never self-reports) and stops on plateau
  (`window` consecutive non-improving iterations), iteration cap, or
  `/loop stop`. This is the anti-doorknob design: the loop only believes a
  number. No auditor in loop 3 — the metric is the verdict. Pure logic in
  `extensions/goal-loop-forever.ts` (22 unit tests).
- **`propose_task_list` tool** — the agent can break a goal into milestones
  after a Confirm dialog. Anti-drift caps: 20 top-level tasks,
  **5 subtasks per task** (pi-goal-x flaw #4). Validation/ids in core,
  8 unit tests. Makes the existing `complete_task` / `update_task_status`
  tools actually usable.
- **`notify=<cmd>` setting** — config-gated push: shells out on goal complete,
  goal pause, and loop stop; message passed as `$1`.
  `/goal-settings notify='echo $1 >> /tmp/log'` — the settings parser is now
  quote-aware (a naive whitespace split mangled quoted commands to `"'echo"`).

### Fixed

- `/goal-settings` key=value parsing handles quoted values with spaces.
- Smoke harness is hermetic: all scenarios run under a bare
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` with a readiness wait — global extensions (including
  older npm installs of this package) can no longer collide with the dev
  build under test, and commands can't race the REPL into the agent.

### Verified live (2026-07-20, `scripts/smoke.sh`)

- `goal`: 5/5 — auditor approval, shield, archive.
- `list`: 4/4 — two queued items auto-advanced through audit, queue drained.
- `loop`: 5/5 — metric 5→0 with per-iteration stall accounting, plateau stop
  at window, `loop_stopped` in ledger, notify fired.
- `draft`: 3/3 — grill → Confirm dialog → audited approval.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-20

Second loop, the anti-bamboozle hardening, and drafting.

### Added

- **Loop 2: `/list`** — queue of goals: `/list add|show|next|remove <n>|clear`.
  Each item is a full goal (objective + verification contract). Completing or
  aborting a list-sourced goal auto-activates the next queued item; a session
  restart with a non-empty queue resumes automatically.
- **regression_shield** — when a goal has a verification contract, the auditor
  MUST produce an `<evidence>` block quoting raw tool output per contract item;
  the orchestrator converts `<approved/>` without complete evidence into a
  disapproval. Kills the "auditor ran `bash true` and approved" hole that
  pi-goal-x's author documented as unfixable-cheaply. Pure logic lives in
  `extensions/goal-loop-shield.ts` (dependency-free, fully unit-tested).
- **Drafting** — `/goal` with no args starts a clarification turn; the agent
  grills one focused question at a time, then `propose_goal_draft` opens a
  real Confirm dialog (Yes/No). Nothing activates before confirmation.
  `/goal "<objective>"` still skips drafting.
- **Escape dialog** — aborting the auditor (Esc) now asks: complete WITHOUT
  audit (user takes verification responsibility) or continue working.
- **Provider warning** — at `session_start`, if no auditor model is configured
  and the session model's provider is not a confirmed built-in, warn once with
  the exact `/goal-settings` fix.
- **Inline contract extraction** — one-liner objectives like
  `Create x.txt. Done when: grep -q ok x.txt` now extract the contract
  (previously only line-start markers worked, silently skipping the shield).
- **Integration harness** — `scripts/smoke.sh [goal|list|draft]` drives a real
  pi session in tmux and asserts on the ledger.

### Fixed

- State functions (`setGoal`/`archiveCurrentGoal`) no longer wipe the queue.
- `readState` restores `list` from the ledger; v0.1.0 ledgers upgrade cleanly.

### Verified live (2026-07-20)

- `/list`: two queued items auto-advanced through work → auditor → archive.
- regression_shield: auditor produced a verbatim `<evidence>` block;
  `shield=True` recorded in history.
- Drafting: grill → sharpened contract → Confirm dialog → audited completion.
- Provider warning fired exactly once on a kilocode session.
- `scripts/smoke.sh goal`: 5/5 assertions.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-20

First live-verified release. Everything in alpha.1, plus the fixes found by
running the loop end-to-end in a real pi session.

### Fixed (all found by live smoke testing)

- **Stale-ctx crash**: timers captured `ExtensionContext` which throws after
  session replacement. All timers now read a `lastCtx` refreshed by every
  event/command handler; stale ctx is detected and dropped safely.
- **API surface**: imports moved to the public entrypoint
  (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) with `Model` from `pi-ai` and
  `ThinkingLevel` from `pi-agent-core`. `sendMessage` is called on the `pi`
  API object, not `ExtensionContext`.
- **Tool contract**: tool results include `details`; command handlers are
  async; the tool event is `tool_call` (not `before_tool_call`).
- **Auditor "no model" failure**: auditor now defaults to `ctx.model` when no
  auditor model is configured, matching pi-goal-x's `resolveAuditorModel`.
- **Auditor model setting works**: `/goal-settings model=provider/id` resolves
  through the model registry (was a placeholder storing an unresolved id).
- **Audit-history pollution**: only non-empty auditor reports are recorded as
  verdicts (infrastructure failures surface via `pauseReason` instead);
  history capped at 20 entries; entries now carry an `error` field.
- **Objective quoting**: `/goal "..."` strips one layer of surrounding quotes.

### Added

- **Command-collision detection** (`warnOnCommandCollision`): pi never throws
  on duplicate command names (first registrant keeps the bare name, later ones
  get `:2`), so we detect duplicates at `session_start` and warn once.
- **Built-in-provider rule documented**: the auditor session has no extensions,
  so it can only use built-in providers. `/goal-settings` warns on save;
  INSTALL.md shows how to verify a model works extension-less.

### Verified live (2026-07-20)

- Full loop: `/goal` → agent works → `complete_goal` → isolated auditor
  (extension-less session, separate model) approves → archived with clean
  1-entry history and a real evidence-based auditor report.
- 5-consecutive-error auto-pause (triggered by a live provider 403 storm).
- Esc during audit: aborts the pi turn; loop recovers via `agent_end`.
  (pi-goal-x's Escape dialog is v0.2.0 scope.)

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] — 2026-07-19

### Added

- **Loop 1 (single goal)**: single ordered goal with isolated auditor.
  - `/goal "<objective>"` — bypass drafting, start now.
  - `/pi-gla-status` — show state + iteration counter + audit history.
  - `/pi-gla-pause` — pause with reason.
  - `/pi-gla-resume` — resume.
  - `/pi-gla-cancel` — abort + archive.
  - `/goaltings` — configure auditor model + thinking level.
  - `complete_goal` tool — spawns isolated auditor.
  - `pause_goal` tool — pause with reason.
  - `complete_task` tool — task tracking helper.
  - `update_task_status` tool — task tracking helper.
- **Isolated auditor** (`goal-loop-auditor.ts`): runs in fresh session, no extensions, no skills, no prompts, read-only tools.
- **JSONL state** (`.pi-gla/active.jsonl`): every state transition persisted.
- **Markdown goal file** (`.pi-gla/goals/<id>.md`): structured rendering replaces pi-goal-x's hand-concat.
- **Hard 5-min backoff cap** (`goal-loop-backoff.ts`): kills the 1-hour wait pathology.
- **Verification contract extraction**: `Done when:`, `Verify:`, `Verified when:` markers split objective from contract.
- **Schema** (`schemas/goal.schema.json`): JSON Schema for goal state.
- **Test suite**: 14 unit tests across 3 files (`tests/`).
- **Example** (`examples/example-objective.md`): worked walkthrough.

### Not included (deferred)

- Drafting phase with structured Q&A → v0.2.0.
- regression_shield auditor requirement (must include raw output) → v0.2.0.
- Loop 2 (list) → v0.2.0.
- Loop 3 (loop) → v0.3.0.
- Native TUI form widget → v0.2.0.
- Live pi session tests → v0.2.0.
- Telegram push → v0.3.0.

### Architecture notes

We deliberately **fork pi-goal-x 0.19.0** as the architectural basis. We **do not** support interop with `pi-goal-x`'s `.pi/goals/` directory. This is a clean break.

We **copy and adapt** the isolated auditor pattern (it's the architectural part that matters), but reduce the per-loop file count (no per-loop plugin files) and replace the hand-concat markdown renderer with structured JSON.
