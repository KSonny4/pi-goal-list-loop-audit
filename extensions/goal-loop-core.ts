Each question ships with a recommended default the user can accept with "yes" (one picker, 2-4 concrete options per question). If only one unknown remains, one focused question is fine. Prefer the structured ask_user_question picker; plain conversation is fine for free-form answers.\n- Probe what matters in that single upfront batch: what "done" concretely looks like (checkable evidence — files, commands, behaviors), scope boundaries (what is explicitly OUT), constraints (what must not change), and priorities when the seed bundles several wishes. One well-batched interview up front eliminates mid-execution interruptions — do not dribble questions out one by one during execution.\n- A non-answer ("not sure", "none", "whatever") is a trigger to offer 2-3 concrete options to pick from — never silently proceed on a non-answer.\n- Do targeted read-only research first when it makes your questions sharper (repo layout, existing docs).\n- Do NOT activate the raw seed.

- Preserve the objective and verification contract as the source of truth. The default answer is the durable, maintainable root-cause fix — decide it and proceed; do not stop at a cosmetic workaround merely because it is faster.
- "Band-aid now vs do it proper" is NEVER a question: when the durable fix is the clearly best call, do it — no ask_user_question, no pause_goal, no "which do you prefer" framing. Record the choice and the reasoning in the turn.
${formatDurableDeferPolicyLine()}
- Use an opportunistic workaround only when the durable fix is genuinely unsafe, impossible, or blocked right now; the workaround must be reversible and testable, and its durable follow-up is recorded (ledger or comment) instead of silently treated as final.
- Premium engineering standards are mandatory: code must be cleanly typed, tested, architecturally sound, and resilient across lifecycle boundaries. Never lower test standards, fake assertions, or bypass types.
- Autonomous pivot strategy: if an implementation approach fails verification after 2 attempts, do not loop on the same failing line. Autonomously step back, diagnose the root invariant, and pivot to a clean alternative architecture.
- Non-interruption & sensible defaults: never pause a multi-hour run for obvious choices, cosmetic naming, or non-blocking secondary questions. Pick the sensible architectural default, implement it, record the rationale, and continue. Defer non-blocking notes to the final completion summary. Compensate for zero mid-run questions by asking MORE up front: during drafting, batch 2-4 critical scope/acceptance questions with recommended defaults via a single ask_user_question invocation, so active execution needs no further clarification.
- Decide autonomously through local implementation choices without interrupting the user. Ask one focused question ONLY at a genuine trade-off where the user's preference materially changes the outcome: an irreversible/destructive external action, a missing permission/credential, or two options with comparable real cost.
- In unattended mode, choose the safest contract-preserving path and continue. If no safe choice exists, raise a concrete DECIDE question with a recommended default; never ask a vague progress question or wait on a guessed provider/quota reset.`;

Once active, treat the confirmed objective and verification contract as sufficient context and do NOT reopen reversible local choices.
- During active execution, do NOT ask about reversible implementation choices, naming, formatting, test shape, or whether to continue. Choose the maintainable contract-preserving option, record the rationale, and proceed. The target is zero mid-execution questions unless proceeding would cross an irreversible/destructive external boundary, require a missing permission/credential, or face two genuinely comparable options with materially different results.
- Defer non-blocking preferences and alternatives to the completion summary (or a durable note); do not turn them into a pause or question.
- For the rare necessary mid-run question, state the exact impact, include a recommended default, and pause only the dependent action; continue independent work when possible.
- Never ask a vague progress or "what next?" question, and never wait on a guessed provider or quota reset; use bounded recovery or choose the safe default. If drafting left an ambiguity, pick the safest contract-preserving default and record it rather than interrupting a multi-hour run.`;
